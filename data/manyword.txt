The magnitude of integration time indicates the strength of integration control. The smaller the integration time is, the stronger the control effect is; On the contrary, the weaker the control effect Although integral control can eliminate residual error, it has the disadvantage of untimely control. Because the accumulation of integral output is gradual, its control effect always lags behind the change of deviation, can not timely and effectively overcome the influence of interference, and it is difficult to stabilize the control system. Therefore, in practice, integral control is not used alone, but combined with proportional control to form proportional integral control. In this way, the advantages of the two are taken to make up for each other, which not only has the rapid and timely function of proportional control, but also has the ability of integral control to eliminate the residual difference. Therefore, proportional integral control can realize ideal process control.
