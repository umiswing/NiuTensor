Michael Jackson wore tape on his nose to get front pages , former bo@@ dy@@ guard claims
Michael Jackson 's former bo@@ dy@@ guard has claimed the late singer cul@@ tiv@@ ated some of his ec@@ cent@@ ri@@ cities with the deliber@@ ate intention of r@@ iling up the media .
Matt F@@ id@@ des , now a property developer and owner of a mar@@ tial arts / dance chain , told Metro that Jackson believed the fasc@@ ination around his person@@ a would stop if he ce@@ ased to be a " mystery " in the public eye .
To get front pages , he would reportedly don surgical masks and put tape on his nose to spark conversation .
We 'll tell you what 's true . You can form your own view .
" He knew how to manipul@@ ate the media . He knew exactly how to get the front page , " F@@ id@@ des , who was Jackson 's bo@@ dy@@ guard for 10 years , said . " 90 per cent of the time it worked , by putting a mask on his face , or st@@ icky tape on his hands - or tape on his nose was a favourite one . He would say he wanted his life to be the greatest mystery on Earth . "
He added : " It 's back@@ fired on him now , though , that 's the sad thing . "
F@@ id@@ des also addressed allegations of child sexual abuse against Jackson by Wade Rob@@ son and James Saf@@ ech@@ u@@ ck , which were aired in the controversial , Emmy A@@ ward-@@ winning documentary Le@@ aving Ne@@ ver@@ land .
Both Rob@@ son and Saf@@ ech@@ u@@ ck alle@@ ge that they were abused by Jackson as children for a number of years .
F@@ id@@ des claimed that " this whole pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile thing is complete non@@ sense ... the guy had girl@@ friends and had a legitimate marriage to Lisa Marie [ Pres@@ ley ] , that was the way he lived his life . "
He claimed it would have been " impossible " for Jackson to have abused children at his Ne@@ ver@@ land ran@@ ch because he was " hardly " there .
" They say there were boys around , that was not the case at all , " he said .
The Jackson estate has denied all allegations against the late star . Jackson denied all claims against him until his death in 2009 .
Government Re@@ ti@@ res 15 More Senior Tax Officials On Gra@@ ft Char@@ ges
New Delhi :
The government has compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 15 more tax officers in the fourth tran@@ che of its crackdown on er@@ rant officials accused of corruption and other mal@@ practices .
The Central Board of Indi@@ rec@@ t Tax@@ es and Customs ( CB@@ IC ) -- the agency that over@@ sees G@@ ST and import tax collec@@ tions -- compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 15 senior officers under Fund@@ am@@ ental Ru@@ le 56 ( J ) on corruption and other charges , official sources said .
Since June , this is the fourth round of s@@ acking of corrupt tax officials . In the previous three rounds , 49 high ranking tax officers , including 12 from the Central Board of Direct Tax@@ es ( CB@@ D@@ T ) , were compul@@ sor@@ ily retired .
Sour@@ ces said the action was in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's address to the nation from the ram@@ parts of the Red Fort when he had said some black she@@ ep in the tax administration may have mis@@ used their powers and harass@@ ed taxpayers , either by targeting honest ass@@ esses or taking excessive action for minor or proce@@ dur@@ al violations .
" We have recently taken the bold step of compul@@ sor@@ ily reti@@ ring a significant number of tax officials , and we will not toler@@ ate this type of behaviour , " he had said .
Nearly half of the officials retired were those who were arrested by the CBI for allegedly receiving illegal gr@@ ati@@ fication . One of them was caught accepting a bri@@ be of Rs 15,000 . One official is accused of having assets disproportion@@ ate to his known source of income .
In June , the government had compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 15 commission@@ er-@@ level officials of CB@@ IC on charges of corruption , collecting and giving bri@@ bes , smug@@ gling and even criminal conspiracy . Prior to that , the government had compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 12 senior IRS officials from the In@@ come Tax department over charges of corruption , sexual harassment , disproportion@@ ate assets under Ru@@ le 56 ( J ) of the Central Civil Services ( Pen@@ sion ) R@@ ules .
In August , the government compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 22 CB@@ IC officials . The Ru@@ le 56 ( J ) of Central Civil Services ( Pen@@ sion ) R@@ ules , 1972 provides for peri@@ o@@ di@@ cal review of the performance of government serv@@ ants with a view to as@@ certain whether they should be re@@ tained in service or retired in public interest .
As per these instructions , the cases of government serv@@ ants covered by F@@ R 56 ( J ) , 56 ( 1 ) or Ru@@ le 48 ( 1 ) ( b ) of CC@@ S ( Pen@@ sion ) R@@ ules , 1972 should be reviewed six months before they at@@ tain the age of 50-@@ 55 years , in cases covered by F@@ R 56 ( j ) and on completion of 30 years of qualifying service under F@@ R 56 ( 1 ) or Ru@@ le 48 of CC@@ S ( Pen@@ sion ) R@@ ules , 1972 .
A woman in Maine got 500 letters from United Healthcare within five days
Stephanie L@@ ay said she found the pil@@ es of letters from the insurance company st@@ ashed in her ma@@ il@@ box between Thursday and Monday .
" A week ago Thursday was the first wave of letters , I got 46 letters , " she told CNN . " I immediately called United Healthcare insurance and told them I received 46 letters of the same letter . "
And the letters just kept coming , pil@@ ing up to more than 500 by Monday .
They were addressed to her son , who has aut@@ ism and lives in a private care facility , she said . But instead of her son 's name inside when you opened them , the letters said De@@ ar Maine 's Department of Health and Human Services -- in Cincinnati , she told local media .
The letters were about a $ 54 or $ 0 healthcare claim that United Healthcare said is not covered , L@@ ay said .
When she asked United Healthcare why she was receiving a mountain of letters , she was told it was a co@@ ding issue , she said .
In a statement , United Healthcare told CNN it 's working to resolve the issue but it cannot provide details due to privacy requirements .
" We have determined the cause of the problem . We are very sorry this occurred , and we have contacted the family to discuss the situation with them , " the health insur@@ er said .
L@@ ay said the letters all have a message at the bottom urging people to go paper@@ less . " I 'm thinking they had to take down half of a forest just to send this , " she said .
Antonio Brown says he 's not quite ready for retirement
Antonio Brown has indicated he 's not reti@@ ring from the NFL , only a few days after announcing he was done with the league in a Twitter rant .
The four-@@ time All-@@ Pro wide receiver wrote on Twitter on Thursday : " I 'm still the best why stop now . " He followed with the suggestion that the game needs him .
Brown has been accused of sexual misconduct by two women . He was released by the New England Patriots last week after playing only one game . He 's been dumped by three teams in the last six months .
Brown , who lost Nike as a spons@@ or last week , says he 'll practice at high schools one day a week , starting in Miami .
The 3@@ 1-year-old Brown also engaged in a Twitter sp@@ at with Los Angeles Rams safety Eric We@@ ddle , who faced him often with the Baltimore Ravens .
HS@@ BC fli@@ ps cri@@ me-@@ spot@@ ting tool to scope new business
British bank HS@@ BC ( HS@@ B@@ A.@@ L ) has converted a financial cri@@ me-@@ spot@@ ting algorith@@ m it was forced to build in the wake of a mon@@ ey-@@ la@@ undering scandal into one that can scope out new business opportunities , bank executives said .
The system combin@@ es data on clients " banking activities , with public data on company ownership and direc@@ tor@@ ships , to flag des@@ ir@@ able potential clients to HS@@ BC staff and offer ways to connect to them through existing relationships .
Using data and artificial intelligence to try and boost revenues is part of HS@@ BC 's broader push to squee@@ ze more out of its large physical network and client data , a key priority for interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn .
" It 's one of the first commercial uses of investment in financial crime prevention , and the business we 're getting in this way is inher@@ ently lower risk and quick@@ er to win , " said Stuart Ni@@ vis@@ on , HS@@ BC 's global head of client network banking .
HS@@ BC declined to comment on how much it expects to make from the new system but said the broader " network income " initiative has already y@@ iel@@ ded hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue .
The drive is an important part of the bank 's efforts to defend its global presence at a time when some analysts and investors are saying it should shr@@ ink or exit markets like the United States where it makes returns below its cost of capital .
HS@@ BC was forced to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in financial crime compliance as part of a $ 1.@@ 9 billion settlement in 2012 with U.S. authorities over the bank 's failure to prevent money la@@ undering by drug car@@ tels though its Mexican unit .
The system works by m@@ apping individual customers " and companies ties to each other and then looking for unusual patterns of transactions or un@@ ear@@ thing previously unknown connections between those ent@@ ities .
That system has already fre@@ ed up more than 400 staff to go from man@@ ually checking transactions and records to cli@@ ent-@@ facing roles where they can spend time helping customers , said Adrian Rig@@ by , chief operating officer of HS@@ BC 's trade business .
HS@@ BC 's Ni@@ vis@@ on said the light@@ bul@@ b moment was re@@ alizing the tool could be re@@ pur@@ posed to look for " green flags " of attractive potential clients rather than " red flags " of wrongdoing .
" We took our customer dat@@ as@@ et and combined it with ( Britain 's ) Companies House data and turned the algorith@@ m around to look for attr@@ acti@@ veness in a client , whether that be through sector , growth of the company , and connection to existing clients , " Ni@@ vis@@ on said .
The tool has m@@ apped 2@@ 2.5 million ent@@ ities and people in Britain , and can identify in three minutes a network of connections that a staff member would have taken three hours to map out man@@ ually , he said .
Iran was promised that ' all ' US sanctions would be lifted in return for talks , Rouhani claims
European nations were so eager to negotiate with Iran that they suggested the US would end its sanctions regime if Tehran was willing to engage in dialogue , President Hassan Rouhani has said .
According to Rouhani , European sign@@ atories of the 2015 nuclear deal urged him to meet with US President Donald Trump , promising that Washington would lift " all " sanctions in return .
" Three out of the six countries , that is the chancellor of Germany , prime minister of Britain , and president of France , all insisted for the meeting to be held , saying that the US would lift all sanctions , " stated the Iranian president .
He said he rejected the proposal because , " under sanctions and maximum pressure , " it would have been impossible to predict the end result of any negotiations .
Trump quickly denied that he had offered Iran any relief , tweeting that Tehran had asked him to lift sanctions as a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite to talks , but that he had " of course " refused .
In his statement , Rouhani also said that numerous countries were on Iran 's side during their one-@@ on-@@ one talks on the sidel@@ ines of the UN@@ GA . " We discussed various issues with various countries , and all of them condemned the United States " withdrawal from the J@@ C@@ PO@@ A and its pressures . This is a huge success for Iran . "
Dog control laws to be reviewed in government consultation
Dog control laws in Scotland are being reviewed amid concerns about out-of-@@ control animals and ir@@ responsible owners .
A consultation has been launched by the Scottish Government seeking the public 's views .
Scotland 's Community Safety Minister pledged to " keep communities safe from ir@@ responsible owners , " with reviews to determine whether laws for out-of-@@ control dogs need changing .
As@@ h Den@@ ham MSP said : " We are holding two reviews into dog control legislation because we are absolutely determined to help keep communities safe from ir@@ responsible owners and their out-of-@@ control dogs .
" This consultation seeks views on improvements on how the Control of Dog@@ s Act 2010 can operate across Scotland , and next year we will take a wider look at all dog control legislation to assess whether changes are needed .
" O@@ w@@ ning a dog brings with it certain responsibilities , including keeping your dog under effective control , and I encourage everyone with an interest in this area to respond to our consultation . "
The consultation runs until January 15 and contains proposals to tou@@ g@@ hen and clar@@ ify the current legislation , including questioning whether a national dog control database should be created .
The Scottish Parliament 's Post-@@ Legislative S@@ cru@@ tiny Committee has been hearing evidence from victims and parents of children who have been attacked or killed by dogs , prompting the Government to review dog control laws .
MS@@ Ps were told the legislation needs urgent reform to protect vulnerable people and children .
The committee heard that , in Greater Glasgow and Cly@@ de alone , there were 1,@@ 4@@ 17 people arriving at A & E departments with do@@ g-@@ related injuries , 25@@ 5 of them children , last year .
NHS Lan@@ ar@@ kshire treated 9@@ 12 people and NHS A@@ yr@@ shire 4@@ 39 , both four-@@ year highs .
In July , the committee 's MS@@ Ps concluded current dog control legislation is not fit for purpose and called on the Scottish Government to under@@ take a comprehensive review of all do@@ g-@@ control laws .
Con@@ ven@@ er Jenny Mar@@ ra said : " Dog law in Scotland is not fit for purpose . There are still far too many dog attacks on children and little enforcement or understanding of the current laws that might prevent these attacks .
" It has become clear that current dog control law doesn 't work . It needs reform urgently so that out of control and dangerous dogs can be dealt with properly and we can try to move to a system that prev@@ ents our children being injured by dogs . "
The consultation , launched on the Government 's website on Friday , says : " Eff@@ ec@@ tive and consistent enforcement across Scotland is fundamental in helping address issues relating to out-of-@@ control dogs .
" This review is focused on steps that can be taken to help aid enforcement agencies such as local authorities , as they use their powers to help keep communities safe . "
Saudi Arabia To Off@@ er Tour@@ ist Vis@@ as For First Time , Ab@@ ol@@ ish Ab@@ aya Ru@@ le
Vis@@ as in Saudi are currently restricted to exp@@ at workers , their depen@@ dents and Muslim pil@@ gri@@ ms .
Saudi Arabia said Friday it will offer tourist vis@@ as for the first time , opening up the ultra-@@ conservative king@@ dom to holi@@ day@@ makers as part of a push to diversi@@ fy its economy away from oil .
Kick@@ starting tourism is one of the cent@@ re@@ pieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman 's Vision 2030 reform programme to prepare the biggest Arab economy for a post-@@ oil era .
The announcement comes just two weeks after devastating attacks on Saudi Arabia 's oil infrastructure -- blamed by Washington on Iran -- which ro@@ iled global energy markets and raised fears of a wider regional conflict .
" Open@@ ing Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country , " tourism chief Ahmed al-@@ K@@ hat@@ ee@@ b said in a statement .
" Vis@@ itors will be surprised ... by the treas@@ ures we have to share -- five UN@@ ES@@ CO World Heritage S@@ ites , a vi@@ b@@ rant local culture and breath@@ taking natural beauty . "
Saudi Arabia will open applications for online tourist vis@@ as to citizens of 49 countries on Saturday , Bloomberg News quoted K@@ hat@@ ee@@ b as saying .
K@@ hat@@ ee@@ b said the king@@ dom will also ease its strict dress code for foreign women , allowing them to go without the bod@@ y-@@ sh@@ rou@@ ding ab@@ aya ro@@ be that is still mandatory public wear for Saudi women .
Foreign women , however , will be required to wear " modest clothing , " he added , without elabor@@ ating .
Vis@@ as in the desert king@@ dom , en@@ do@@ wed with rich be@@ dou@@ in heritage and arch@@ ae@@ ological sites , are currently restricted to exp@@ at workers , their depen@@ dents and Muslim pil@@ gri@@ ms travelling to hol@@ y sites in M@@ ec@@ ca and Med@@ ina .
In a rare move , Saudi Arabia last year began issuing temporary vis@@ as to visitors to attend sporting and cultural events in a bid to kick@@ start tourism .
But the au@@ st@@ ere king@@ dom , which for@@ bi@@ ds alcohol and has a strict social code , is seen by many as a hard sell for tourists .
Prince Mohammed is seeking to change that through a sweeping liber@@ alisation drive that has brought new cinemas , mix@@ ed-@@ gender concer@@ ts and sporting extravag@@ anz@@ as to Saudi Arabia .
International criticism of the king@@ dom 's human rights record , including the gru@@ esome murder last year of critic Jamal Khashoggi and a crackdown on female activists , could further put off foreign visitors , observers say .
Fe@@ ars of a regional conflict after the September 14 attacks on state oil giant Aram@@ co may also damp@@ en the king@@ dom 's appeal to holi@@ day@@ makers .
The government , re@@ eling from low oil prices , says it hopes tourism will contribute up to 10 percent of the gross domestic product by 2030 , compared to three percent currently .
It says by 2030 it aims to attract up to 100 million annual visits by both domestic and foreign tourists .
But the king@@ dom currently l@@ acks the infrastructure to accom@@ o@@ date visitors in such high numbers , with officials estim@@ ating 500,000 new hotel rooms will be required nationwide over the coming decade .
The sector is expected to create up to one million tourism jobs , the government says , as it battles high youth unemployment .
Saudi Arabia has spl@@ urged billions in an attempt to build a tourism industry from scrat@@ ch .
In 2017 , the king@@ dom announced a multi-@@ billion dollar project to turn 50 islands and other pri@@ stine sites on the Red Sea into luxury res@@ orts .
Last year , construction of Q@@ id@@ di@@ ya " entertainment city " was launched near Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ h , which would include high-@@ end theme parks , motor sport facilities and a sa@@ far@@ i area .
The country is also developing historic sites such as the cent@@ uri@@ es-@@ old Mad@@ a '@@ in Sal@@ eh , home to sand@@ stone tom@@ bs of the same ci@@ vil@@ isation which built the Jord@@ an@@ ian city of Pet@@ ra .
Facebook hi@@ des ' likes ' in new Australia trial
Facebook has begun hiding the number of " likes " for posts in Australia , it said today , a trial designed to ease social pressure that could be rolled out worldwide .
Account holders across the country will also be blocked from viewing the number of reactions and video views on other people 's posts from today , but will still be able to see how people respond to their own .
" We don 't want Facebook to feel like a competition , " the company said in a statement .
" This is a test to see how people engage with this new format . We hope to learn from this over time in order to see if we will roll this out more broadly , " it said .
More than one billion people use Facebook worldwide , but the social media giant has come under pressure to combat the platform 's impact on mental health .
In Australia , one in five children report experiencing cyber@@ bullying , according to the country 's e@@ Safety commissioner .
Facebook 's decision comes after it launched a trial in July to hide " likes " on the company 's other major social media platform , Instagram .
What began as a test on Instagram in Canada was expanded to Australia , Brazil and several other major markets .
The Facebook trial was described as " a limited test in order for us to get some early lear@@ nings . "
" While this has been testing on Instagram , Facebook and ( Instagram ) are different surfaces and we will likely see different data come from this test , " the company said .
The social media giant did not confirm how long the trial would run for .
" We want to understand from people whether removing the total counts impro@@ ves their experience , while also not limiting any positive interactions , " said Mia Gar@@ lick , of Facebook Australia .
Lor@@ enz@@ o strength@@ ens into C@@ ateg@@ ory 4 hurricane east of Caribbean
Hurricane Lor@@ enz@@ o strength@@ ened into a C@@ ateg@@ ory 4 storm Thursday , producing sw@@ ells that could affect parts of the Wind@@ ward Islands and South America , the National Hurricane Center said .
The eye of the major hurricane was about 1,@@ 6@@ 60 miles south@@ west of the A@@ zo@@ res in the NH@@ C 's 11 p.m. EDT update . The storm was moving north-@@ north@@ west at 14 mph with 14@@ 5 mph maximum sustained winds .
The storm isn 't forecast to make land@@ fall in the coming days , though a turn toward the northeast Saturday could bring Lor@@ enz@@ o near the A@@ zo@@ res in the middle of next week . Forec@@ asters predict the storm will weak@@ en below C@@ ateg@@ ory 3 on Monday .
Sw@@ ells generated by the storm could cause life-@@ threatening sur@@ f and ri@@ p curr@@ ents in the Wind@@ ward Islands and nor@@ theastern South America .
Lor@@ enz@@ o is the season 's second C@@ ateg@@ ory 4 or higher storm . Dorian reached C@@ ateg@@ ory 5 status near the Bahamas .
According to Colorado State University Meteor@@ ologist Philip Klo@@ tz@@ bach , the Western H@@ emisph@@ ere , which en@@ comp@@ ass@@ es the Atlantic and eastern Pacific bas@@ ins , has generated 16 named storms since Aug. 21 .
" This is the most on record for the Western H@@ emisph@@ ere between Aug. 21@@ -S@@ ept . 23 , breaking the old record of 15 named storms set in 1984 and 2002 , " he wrote on Twitter .
Patri@@ ot missile system to Saudi Arabia after Iran oil attacks
U.S. Sol@@ di@@ ers talk after a routine inspec@@ tion of a Patri@@ ot missile battery at a Turkish military base in Ga@@ zi@@ an@@ te@@ p , Turkey .
The Pentagon on Thursday announced that the U.S. will send a Patri@@ ot missile battery , ra@@ dar@@ s and roughly 200 support personnel to Saudi Arabia in the wake of the attacks on its oil facilities earlier this month .
Defense Secretary Mark Esper has " approved putting additional forces on prepare to deploy orders , " Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoff@@ man wrote in a statement . " While no decision has been made to deploy these additional forces , they will maintain a heightened state of read@@ iness . "
Those additional forces include two Patri@@ ot missile ar@@ til@@ ler@@ y batteries and one Termin@@ al High Alt@@ itude Area Defense , or TH@@ A@@ AD missile defense system .
TH@@ A@@ AD , one of the world 's most advanced missile systems , can target in@@ coming missiles and blast them out of the sky . TH@@ A@@ AD inter@@ c@@ ept@@ ors , fired from a tru@@ ck@@ -based laun@@ cher , use k@@ ine@@ tic energy to deliver " hit to kill " strikes to bal@@ li@@ stic threats .
" It is important to note these steps are a demonstration of our commitment to regional partners , and the security and stability in the Middle East . Other countries have called out Iranian mis@@ advent@@ ures in the region , and we look for them to rein@@ force Saudi Arabia 's defense , " Hoff@@ man wrote .
President Donald Trump slammed Iran 's alleged role in the attacks on Saudi oil facilities , telling world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that they should pressure Tehran into diplomatic talks .
" All nations have a duty to act , " Trump said regarding his call to counter Iranian behavior . " No responsible government should subsi@@ di@@ ze Iran 's bloo@@ d@@ l@@ ust . As long as Iran 's men@@ acing behavior continues , sanctions will not be lifted , they will be ti@@ ghtened . "
The Sept . 14 strikes on the world 's largest cru@@ de-@@ processing plant and oil field forced Saudi Arabia to shut down half of its production operations . The drone attacks triggered the largest spike in crude prices in decades and renewed concerns of a bu@@ dding conflict in the Middle East . While Tehran has been widely blamed for the attacks , it main@@ tains that it was not involved .

The 28@@ -year-old woman was sky@@ di@@ ving with a group of seven people around 2 p.m. Thursday , California Highway Patrol P@@ I@@ O Ru@@ ben Jones told CNN .
The group took off from the Lo@@ di Par@@ ach@@ ute Center . CNN has reached out to the facility for comment .

" The way the person was struggling , just struggling against the wind and their body was just moving really , really fast , " she told the station .
'@@ H@@ ide@@ ous ' Central Coast cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age child rap@@ ist ordered to look at victim in court
D@@ ressed in a le@@ af@@ y Gh@@ ill@@ ie cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age suit , the man grabbed the then 12@@ -year-old from behind and dragged her into bush@@ land as she made her way to school on the state 's Central Coast in May 2017 .
He then tied her to a tree and sexually assaulted her .
Shor@@ tly after the arrest , a search warrant was executed at a home where officers seized a number of items relevant to the investigation .
The man pleaded guilty to seven charges involving the attack and a further three charges over the gro@@ oming and sexual abuse of another girl , aged 11 , between August 2016 and April 2017 .
The 12@@ -year-old victim had been walking along a track when she looked back and saw him suddenly emerge from the bus@@ hes armed with a large tree branch and a knife .
An example of a cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age Gh@@ ill@@ ie suit the man used .
When she pleaded " stop , stop , stop , " he put her in a head@@ lock and forced her into the scru@@ b .
The man told the girl : " Sh@@ h@@ h , don 't scre@@ am . Don 't scre@@ am or I 'll have to hurt you . "
Hol@@ ding the knife in his right hand , he tied her hands and feet with cable ties before lash@@ ing her to the tree and ab@@ using her for almost an hour . After he cut her loose , the girl ran crying hyster@@ ically to school .
The man arrived at work about 9.@@ 30@@ am after failing to reply to several text messages and phone calls from colleagues .
With dirt , grass and tree matter on his clothes , he claimed to have been involved in a road rage incident where he had ch@@ ased another driver into the bush and fallen down an em@@ bank@@ ment .
The man 's sentencing hearing continues on Tuesday .
No federal charges in fatal California police shooting
Federal authorities declined to pursue civil rights charges Thursday against Sacramento police officers who fat@@ ally shot an un@@ armed black man , a killing that sparked protests and sp@@ urred changes to a state law governing when authorities can use deadly force .
The U.S. Attorney 's Office and the FBI said a federal review of the 2018 shooting of 22@@ -year-old Steph@@ on Clark found " in@@ sufficient evidence " to pursue charges against Officers Ter@@ rance Mer@@ cad@@ al and Jared Rob@@ in@@ et . Both will be returned to active duty .
The California attorney general 's office in March declined to issue state criminal charges after a nearly year@@ long investigation . Attorney General X@@ avier Bec@@ er@@ ra said then evidence showed the officers had reason to believe their lives were in danger because he was adv@@ ancing toward them holding what they thought was a gun . Investig@@ ators found only a cell@@ phone .
Sacramento police also announced Thursday their internal investigation did not find any policy or training violations .
" Although no policy violations occurred in this incident or in the events leading up to it , we are committed to implementing strategies that may prevent similar trag@@ e@@ dies in the future , " Sacramento Police Chief Daniel H@@ ahn said in a statement .
Clark 's brother , Ste@@ van@@ te Clark , posted on Facebook Thursday that he was in a meeting with federal and local authorities . " These people have failed when it comes to ( accountability ) , " he wrote .
Authorities have said the officers believed Clark was approaching them with a gun after he ran from them into his grand@@ parents " back@@ yard . The officers had been pursuing Clark after receiving calls about someone breaking car windows and an elderly neighbor 's sli@@ ding glass door .
The officers shot Clark seven times as he approached them .
The federal investigation looked at evidence such as witness statements , audio and video rec@@ ord@@ ings , dis@@ patch records , police reports , and au@@ top@@ sy reports to determine whether the officers acted will@@ fully with the intent to use objec@@ tively un@@ reasonable force .
Law@@ makers last month updated the nation 's oldest law governing police use of deadly force , making it now among the country 's most comprehensive when combined with additional training .
California 's old standard made it rare for police officers to be charged following a shooting and r@@ arer still for them to be convicted . It was based on the doc@@ tr@@ ine of " reasonable fear , " meaning if prosecutors or jur@@ ors believed officers had a reason to fear for their safety , they could use lethal force .
The new law , which takes effect Jan. 1 , will allow police to use deadly force only when " necessary " to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious injury to officers or by@@ st@@ anders .
Pope warns tech exec@@ s to use AI for the common good
Pope Francis on Friday warned tech company executives , diplomats and fin@@ anc@@ iers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development pose the risk of increasing social inequality unless the work is accompanied by an ethical evalu@@ ation of the common good .
Francis addressed a Vati@@ can conference that brought government en@@ vo@@ ys and Facebook and Google representatives together with philosoph@@ ers , physi@@ c@@ ists and eth@@ ic@@ ists . A s@@ mat@@ tering of academ@@ ics and Catholic b@@ ish@@ ops ro@@ unded out participants at " The Common Good in the Digital Age " conference .
The three-@@ day gathering is the latest evidence of the Vati@@ can wanting a place in the debate over the prospects and per@@ ils of artificial intelligence .
The debates included technology adv@@ anc@@ ements in war@@ fare and the future of work with increasing reli@@ ance on machines , as well as a case study exam@@ ining the Christchurch , New Zealand , mass@@ acre and decisions taken by social media companies after video spread of the car@@ n@@ age .
In his speech to the conference , Francis praised the potential of technological progress , noting that machines at the da@@ wn of the industrial revolution sp@@ ared workers dangerous and mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous labor . But he warned that increased reli@@ ance on robo@@ tics for the sake of profits ris@@ ked depri@@ ving people of the dignity of labor .
" If technological adv@@ anc@@ ement became the cause of increasingly evident in@@ equ@@ alities , it would not be true and real progress , " he warned . " If man@@ kind 's so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good , this would lead to an unfortunate reg@@ res@@ sion to a form of bar@@ bar@@ ism dict@@ ated by the law of the strongest . "
Organ@@ iz@@ ers of the conference said they hoped to tap into participants " expertise identify possible future advisers for the Catholic Church on high tech issues .
The House voted Friday to block the national emergency declaration President Donald Trump is using to fund his proposed border wall .
The Democr@@ ati@@ c-@@ held chamber passed a resolution to termin@@ ate Trump 's action by a 23@@ 6-@@ 17@@ 4 margin , sending it to the president . Ele@@ ven Republicans and one independent supported it . The Senate already approved the measure in a 5@@ 4-@@ 41 vote , as 11 Republicans joined Democrats in backing it .
Trump will likely ve@@ to the resolution , the sixth time he will have blocked congressional legislation as president . He already vet@@ o@@ ed a measure to end the emergency declaration in March .
Neither chamber of Congress appears to have the two-thirds majority needed to over@@ ride the president 's opposition .
F@@ ailing to get the funding he des@@ ired for borders on the southern border from both the Mexican government and Congress , Trump declared the national emergency in February . His administration plans to pull $ 3.@@ 6 billion from military construction to fund border projects .
Democrats have accused Trump of both circ@@ um@@ vent@@ ing Congress ' power of the pur@@ se and ra@@ iding key Defense funds for unnecessary barriers . A handful of Republicans in both the House and Senate also had concerns about the precedent Trump 's declaration would set for executive over@@ reach in the future .
Some Senate Republicans facing elections next year have faced sharp political pressure over the national emergency vote .

If you take the company 's incorpor@@ ation date as its birthday , then Google was born on September 4 , 1998 , however , the company never celebrated the day as its birthday , at least not in the form of a d@@ oo@@ dle . Google celebrated September 7 as its birthday in d@@ ood@@ les until 2005 , following which it switched to September 27 .
Initi@@ ally , the search engine was called " Back@@ Ru@@ b " and it was later ren@@ amed " Google . "
" We chose our systems name , Google , because it is a common sp@@ elling of goo@@ go@@ l , or 10@@ 100 and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines , " Serge@@ y Br@@ in and Lawrence ( Larry ) Page wrote in 1998 in a paper published about launching a proto@@ type of a " large-scale search engine . "
The company got its start thanks to Sun co-founder Andy Be@@ cht@@ ol@@ sh@@ eim who invested $ 100,000 ; in June 1999 , the company had raised a $ 25 million round from Se@@ quo@@ ia Capital and Kl@@ einer Per@@ kins . Google moved to its Mountain View location in the same year , where it remains . In 2001 , the company was granted a pat@@ ent for its technology .
What started out as a Web search engine has since turned into a massive con@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate that calls itself Alphabet and Google is a subsi@@ diary company . Today , Google operates all over the world in over 100 languages , answer@@ ing tr@@ illions of search qu@@ eries each year .
" The relent@@ less search for better answers continues to be at the core of everything we do , " Google writes on its Our Story page . " Today , with more than 6@@ 0,000 employees in 50 different countries , Google makes hundreds of products used by billions of people across the globe , from YouTube and Android to Smart@@ box and , of course , Google Se@@ arch . Although we 've dit@@ ched the Le@@ go servers and added just a few more company dogs , our passion for building technology for everyone has stayed with us - from the dor@@ m room , to the garage , and to this very day .
Oil falls after Iran claims US offered to remove sanctions , Trump denies
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani makes a speech during a ceremony in Tehran , Iran on January 10 , 2019 .
Oil sli@@ d after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani claimed Friday that the U.S. offered to remove all sanctions on Iran in exchange for negotiations . President Donald Trump and the State Department later denied those claims , causing oil to rebound from the lows .
WT@@ I crude futures were last down by 0.@@ 9 % to $ 5@@ 5.@@ 91 after falling as low as $ 5@@ 4.@@ 79 . Brent crude futures dropped 1.4 % to $ 6@@ 1.@@ 89 .
" The German chancellor , the prime minister of England ( Britain ) and the president of France were in New York and all insisted that this meeting take place . And America says that it will lift the sanctions , " Rouhani said on his official website , according to Reuters . " It was up for debate what sanctions will be lifted and they ( the United States ) had said clearly that we will lift all sanctions . "
Trump later said he responded " of course , N@@ O ! " to Iran who he said wanted him to lift the sanctions in order to meet .
The State Department called the report " bas@@ eless , " adding the U.S. is committed to zero oil exports from the Iranian regime , Bloomberg News said .
Rouhani 's comment came after a series of drones attacked oil facilities in Saudi Arabia on Sept . 14 , which had forced the king@@ dom to cut production in half . The U.S. and some European countries , as well as Saudi Arabia , have blamed the attack on Iran . Tehran has denied any role in the incident . The Trump administration also announced plans to deploy U.S. forces to the region .
The State Department didn 't immediately respond to CNBC 's request for comment .
" There 's been a big be@@ ar@@ ish risk from a th@@ a@@ w in the US Iran situation for some time and this will put a remarkable amount of oil back onto the market immediately if it were to occur , " said John Kil@@ du@@ ff of Again Capital .
" It 's not just Iranian production and exports . Its ' millions of bar@@ rels in floating storage and millions of bar@@ rels sitting in China 's ports waiting to be processed by customs , " Kil@@ du@@ ff said .
Trump last year withdrew the U.S. from a nuclear deal between Iran , the U.S. and five other countries that removed sanctions from the country in return for its commitment to end its nuclear .
The Islamic Republic , a target of U.S. sanctions for decades , was blamed by Washington for recent attacks on oil t@@ ank@@ ers in the Stra@@ it of Hor@@ mu@@ z , which Tehran denies . Iran also shot down a U.S. military drone and announced plans to exec@@ ute 17 suspected U.S. sp@@ ies .
Afghanistan boo@@ sts security for presidential election
A massive security operation is in place across Afghanistan for the country 's presidential election on Saturday .
About 100,000 security personnel are to guard polling stations in the wake of Taliban threats .
The fear of re@@ pris@@ als means many voters - particularly in rural areas - will stay at home , while others say the voting system fav@@ ours the powerful , not the poor .
Royal news : How Princess Beatrice " reacted with f@@ ury at hostile family members "
On Thursday , The Duke and Duchess of York announced that their el@@ dest daughter , Princess Beatrice , is engaged to her boyfriend , the 3@@ 4-@@ year old property ty@@ coon E@@ do@@ ardo Map@@ elli Mo@@ zz@@ i . The Princess , who is nin@@ th-@@ in-@@ line to the thr@@ one , will tie the k@@ not with Mr Map@@ elli Mo@@ zz@@ i next year . The couple said in a statement : " We are both so excited to be embar@@ king on this life adventure together .
" We share so many similar interests and values , and we know that this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead , full of love and happiness . "
Princess Beatrice 's parents , Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson , also shared their excitement .
The Duchess of York wrote on Twitter : " I know what a mother feels so I have tears of joy . I am so proud of this sens@@ ational news .
" Andrew and I are just the lu@@ ck@@ iest people ever to have two great sons in law . "
The royal wedding will be another occasion for the entire Royal Family to get together , and hopefully completely repair Ferg@@ ie 's relationship with the Duke of Edinburgh .
Since Sarah was embro@@ iled in one of the Royal Family 's biggest ever sc@@ andals , her relationship with the rest of the members has been extremely difficult .
Five months after announcing she was separ@@ ating from Prince Andrew in 1992 , com@@ promising photographs of her with her " financial advisor " were taken at her holiday villa in St Tro@@ pez .
The sn@@ aps appeared to show Tex@@ an milli@@ onaire John Bryan kis@@ sing and su@@ cking the Duchess " to@@ es and the arch of her foot , and Prince Philip in particular , is said to have had the strongest reaction to her daugh@@ ter-@@ in-@@ law 's sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous an@@ tics .
However , his behaviour was reportedly " app@@ alling " towards the Duchess of York , and Princess Beatrice once claimed her mother was the victim of " mean spir@@ ited actions to make her feel un@@ welcome . "

The report noted that the Duchess " spokesman was unable to comment on the claims , but a friend of Ferg@@ ie was quoted as saying : " It is no secret that Sarah 's daughters are pretty fed up by the way their mother has been treated by some members of the Royal Family .
" Some of the bills she has been sent have been pretty miser@@ ly .
" They are constantly ber@@ ating their father for allowing it to happen and Beatrice in particular has been im@@ pl@@ oring Prince Andrew to see that their mother is not treated as an out@@ cast . "
Philip and Sarah were pictured for the first time together in 26 years at Princess Eu@@ gen@@ ie 's wedding to Jack Brook@@ s@@ bank last October .
The Next Big Labor Stri@@ ke Hits Oregon
The state university workers " most pressing complaints center on low wages and a lack of dignity at work . The pay dispar@@ ities alone are shocking . About half of these workers earn less than $ 40,000 per year ( and hundreds make less than $ 25,000 ) . Meanwhile , university presidents " annual salaries average out to $ 500,000 and four university athle@@ tics coaches are pulling down a cool $ 1 million . While school administ@@ rators enjoy six-@@ figure salaries and overall administrative spending continues to blo@@ at , one in six classified staff@@ ers qualify for food st@@ amps .
As Ale@@ j@@ andro Seg@@ ur@@ ra , another IT worker at Portland State University , said , " I 'm willing to go on strike because I don 't think it 's fair that people are paid wages that don 't allow them to live in the city that they serve . " Portland State library worker Theresa Stap@@ le@@ burg was even more direct : " I want to strike because I 've been here 24 years , and I need a raise - a living wage . "
As inflation clim@@ bs and the cost of living in Oregon so@@ ars , these workers are being left to flo@@ under , and management has shown little sympath@@ y for their p@@ light . Contr@@ act negotiations that began in February broke down in mid-@@ August . At that point , the bosses had laid out some particularly e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous proposals - a pal@@ try co@@ st-@@ of-@@ living increase , a den@@ ial of sen@@ i@@ ority demands from long-term university workers , and a price hike for staff meals - that workers saw as dis@@ respectful , and even cruel . " There is an un@@ written class system at the universities , " Ful@@ mer said . " And we are at the bottom of it . "
" Education workers have been under attack for decades , " he continued . " We are finally standing up and fighting back . It 's one thing to see class@@ ism and the squee@@ zing of the middle class in the corporate world as executives see their relatively ob@@ scene pay continue to go up at rates above inflation . But for the same thing to be happening in education is not something workers will continue to toler@@ ate . "
And Oregon 's state university workers aren 't the only ones taking action . Oregon is a powder ke@@ g of milit@@ ancy right now , and its f@@ use is now burning bright and hot . Gro@@ cer@@ y store workers at the Fred Me@@ yer supermarket chain are ramp@@ ing up their campaign against their employer , and while there are no official plans to strike yet , tensions are running high ; their union , United Food and Commer@@ cial Workers Local 5@@ 55 , has already called for a boy@@ cott , and filed an unfair labor practice report against the chain .
In the healthcare sector , the 4,@@ 500 members of the Service Emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es International Union Local 49 workers at Kaiser Per@@ man@@ ente authorized a strike ( with a 98 percent approval rate ) if a deal isn 't reached before their existing contract exp@@ ires in October - which was only nar@@ row@@ ly avoided with a new tent@@ ative agreement . Elsewhere in the industry , the Oregon Nur@@ ses Association , which represents more than 120 nurses at A@@ stor@@ ia Hospital , has been dead@@ locked in contract negotiations with the hospital administration ; their last contract exp@@ ired in May , and the clock is ti@@ cking .
" Oregon has a really strong labor movement that is really building from the ground up , " Bur@@ ley explains . " This is a part of the national wave of labor growth . People are seeing a pre@@ car@@ ious economy where real wages are falling and the solution is collective action in the workplace . "
It 's unclear just how deeply such collective action may take root this fall , but it certainly would be fitting if the general strike returned to the North@@ west in 2019 . And from there we can only hope that its spirit will spread even further , into the heart of Mid@@ western farming , Southern manufacturing , Tex@@ an oil fields , App@@ al@@ ach@@ ian coal mines , Nor@@ theastern construction , the Silicon Valley tech giants , and everywhere in between . Lord knows that something 's go@@ tta give .
C@@ iv@@ ility in Politics : New awards scheme set up to counter Westminster division and recognise politicians who show courtesy
A new awards scheme has been set up to recognise politicians who show courtesy in their work .
It comes after a divisive week in Westminster following the return of Parliament .
It was marked by threats against MPs and outrage over the language used by the likes of Prime Minister Boris Johnson .
To counter the division , the " C@@ iv@@ ility in Politics " awards were announced on Friday , with the politician of the year to be awarded £ 3,000 to give to charity .
Boris Johnson has been criticised for the tone of language he has used in the Commons chamber
Lord Stewart , announcing the awards , said : " Everyone agrees that politics in the UK is facing a crisis of trust and a crisis of ci@@ v@@ ility .
" As divisions and bitter@@ ness mount in the continuing debates around Brexit , we strongly believe that politics has to respond not by mir@@ ror@@ ing these trends , but by bu@@ cking them .
" These awards are a small attempt by a group of people in public life - of different and no political persu@@ as@@ ions - to shine a spotlight on politicians who argue their case with dec@@ ency and ci@@ v@@ ility , and are able to engage and work with people across the divi@@ des that affect us all . "
Nomin@@ ations will open on Saturday , with an award ceremony in March next year .
In an exclusive interview with the Standard , former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd today accused Mr Johnson of deplo@@ ying aggressive language that " does inc@@ ite violence . "
Mr Johnson , for his part , said he " deplo@@ res " threats made against MPs .
Jess Phillips ' fri@@ ghtened ' after receiving ' be afraid ' death threats
On Thursday , Labour MP Jess Phillips - another one of those to have criticised Mr Johnson - said a man was arrested after trying to " kick the door " of her constituency office while reportedly shouting that she was a " fasc@@ ist . "
Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson , meanwhile , was speaking to police following threats made to one of her young children .
And in a viral Twitter thre@@ ad , Ellie Cooper , the daughter of senior Labour MP Y@@ v@@ ette Cooper , described her fears for her mother in the wake of Ms Cox 's murder . She accused Mr Johnson of " using language that helps inc@@ ite violence toward MPs . "
Set@@ ting the example ? In@@ come inequality in the US is at an all-time high
Last year the income gap between rich@@ est and poo@@ rest people in the US stood at its highest level since 1967 , the first year the Census Bureau started tracking it . DC and New York are among places where the differences are worst .
The US may be the world 's wealth@@ iest nation , but it is also one where the super-@@ rich thrive no matter what while the desperately poor often rely on GoFund@@ Me to pay their medical bills . The economic inequality affects both wealth and incomes , with the latter being at an all-time high .
One way to measure income inequality is the G@@ ini index . It measures between 0 , a score for absolute equality and 1 , which stands for a hy@@ pothe@@ tical situation in which a single household gets all income in a nation . The Census Bureau has been tracking the index for over 50 years . In 1967 it stood at 0.@@ 3@@ 97 but , in 2018 , it rose to 0.@@ 4@@ 85 , the highest figure on the record .
There are nations with worse income in@@ equ@@ alities , including some with reason@@ ably strong economies . For example , the World Bank estimates that South Africa 's G@@ ini index stood at 0.@@ 63 in 2014 while Brazil 's was 0.@@ 53 in 2017 . By comparison , all EU countries have a G@@ ini index below 0.@@ 4 .
The new data shows that income inequality is most acute in places where wealth is concentr@@ ated , including DC , New York and Connecticut , as well as in po@@ vert@@ y-@@ rid@@ den areas like Puerto Rico and Louisiana . Utah , Alaska , Iowa , North Dakota and South Dakota had the most economic equality .
The census also showed a stag@@ n@@ ating growth of median household income , which grew to over $ 6@@ 2,000 . It 's the highest level ever measured by the American Community Survey , but the increase was just 0.@@ 8 from 2017 to 2018 , much smaller compared to increases in the previous three years and amo@@ unting to virtually no growth at all if adjusted to inflation .
The new statistics will likely put some wind into the sa@@ ils of progressive Democratic contenders for the party nomination for next year 's presidential election , who call for leaning on the super-@@ wealthy individuals and on big corporations to pay more taxes .
It may also undermine the ration@@ ale behind the current administration 's corporate tax breaks , which were passed through Congress in 2017 . The goal was to convince multin@@ ation@@ als to bring back manufacturing jobs as money tri@@ ck@@ les down to the middle and poor classes . In practice , it seems , it led to extra bon@@ uses for executives and the rest of the country largely missing out on the benefits a growing economy and record low unemployment . Well , someone needs to pay for all those private jet trips .
North Carolina man wins five times in the same lot@@ tery drawing
A North Carolina man won five times in the same lot@@ tery drawing , including a $ 16@@ 3,@@ 6@@ 34 jack@@ pot .
Add Lanc@@ aster of P@@ ik@@ ev@@ ille told North Carolina Education Lot@@ tery officials he used five sets of his own numbers to buy a Cash 5 ticket with five plays for Monday night 's drawing when he stopped at Wis@@ sam & Brothers Inc. in P@@ ik@@ ev@@ ille .
" My wife writes down the numbers for me during the drawing , " Lanc@@ aster said . " When she handed me the paper , so I could check my ticket , I couldn 't believe it .

Kh@@ loe Kardashian 's cheating ex T@@ rist@@ an Thompson leaves AN@@ O@@ TH@@ ER desperate comment on her Instagram p@@ ic after rumours he wants her back
K@@ H@@ LO@@ E Kardashian 's cheating ex T@@ rist@@ an Thompson has left AN@@ O@@ TH@@ ER desperate comment on her Instagram page following rumours that he wants her back .
The 35@@ -year-old star dumped the NBA player for good earlier this year after he was accused of cheating on her with family friend Jord@@ yn Woods - having previously che@@ ated when she was nine months pregnant with their daughter , True .
T@@ rist@@ an was spotted leaving another g@@ ushing compli@@ ment on Kh@@ loe 's Instagram page
However , 28@@ -year-old T@@ rist@@ an is refusing to give up without a fight - leaving a cr@@ in@@ ge@@ worthy compli@@ ment on his ex 's latest selfie .
In the bl@@ urred snap , Kh@@ loe is stood in front of the rising sun , with the m@@ um-@@ of-@@ one cap@@ tioning the p@@ ic : " May you have the courage to explore every dream you dream . "
Publi@@ c@@ ly comment@@ ing , T@@ rist@@ an wrote : " The sun is sh@@ ining bright on a beautiful [ diam@@ ond emo@@ ji ] . "
Fans were ou@@ tr@@ aged by the re@@ mark , with one re@@ plying : " Yeah , a diam@@ ond that you D@@ RO@@ PP@@ ED . "
T@@ rist@@ an che@@ ated on Kh@@ loe when she was nine months pregnant
Another advised : " Just get off Instagram . "
A third wrote : " Don 't fall for it Kh@@ loe . "
It comes just days after T@@ rist@@ an wrote : " Per@@ f@@ ection " alongside the heart eye emo@@ j@@ is underneath one of the reality stars other photos , which saw her mod@@ elling for Gu@@ ess Je@@ ans .
Earlier this month , The Sun revealed that T@@ rist@@ an bought Kh@@ loe a £ 400,000 Por@@ sche in a bid to win her back - on the advice of Drake .
He was then accused of cheating again earlier this year - with Kardashian family friend Jord@@ yn Woods
He settled on the gro@@ v@@ elling gift , thought to be a 911 , after being urged to pull a " power move " by his rapper pal .
As a result , p@@ als said T@@ rist@@ an even won an invite from Kh@@ loe to a ' Tac@@ o Tuesday ' dinner at her mansion - bringing him one step closer to a re@@ union with the reality star and their 17-@@ month-@@ old daughter True .
A source said : " T@@ rist@@ an is good p@@ als with Drake and has been using him as a so@@ unding board as he p@@ lots his return to the Kardashian fold .
Kh@@ loe was left heart@@ broken by T@@ rist@@ an 's in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity
" Drake told him to pull out all the stops if he wanted to win Kh@@ loe back .
" An invite to a casual dinner might not sound like a reasonable trade off for a sle@@ ek super@@ car .
" But after what T@@ rist@@ an did , he can 't expect Kh@@ loe to roll out the red carpet for him . "

Kh@@ loe Kardashian breaks down in tears and scre@@ ams at cheating boyfriend T@@ rist@@ an Thompson in new Ke@@ eping Up With The Kardash@@ ians series 16 trailer
The Sun revealed last month that T@@ rist@@ an planned to invite Kh@@ loe on a romantic trip to Greece after vo@@ wing : " I will get my family back . "
Kh@@ loe has been left heart@@ broken by T@@ rist@@ an 's repeated cheating throughout their romance , but still invited him to their daughter True 's first birthday party earlier this year .
However , the star 's family reality show Ke@@ eping Up With The Kardash@@ ians later showed that the event ended with Kh@@ loe in tears as she struggled to come to terms with his in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity .
Ste@@ m cells of 56 child cancer patients lost at Children 's Hospital after free@@ zer mal@@ function
A free@@ zer mal@@ function at Children 's Hospital Los Angeles resulted in the loss of 56 children 's blood stem cells that were har@@ vest@@ ed at the beginning of each patient 's on@@ c@@ ology therapy and stored in the event they could prove useful in the future .
" We apologi@@ ze for any distress or confusion that this has caused our patients and their families , " the hospital wrote in a statement . " If you have not received a letter or phone call from our team , your child is not impacted . "
All but one patient had gone through initial therapy . That patient did require the rec@@ olle@@ ction of stem cells , chief medical officer James Stein said .
A letter sent to families earlier in September inform@@ ing them of the loss was accidentally addressed to the children - rather than the parents . The hospital has also apologi@@ zed to parents for the messaging oversight .
The hospital said that the loss of stem cells , which had been placed in long-term storage , has not je@@ opar@@ di@@ zed any child 's health . The hospital has also offered to assist families who want to har@@ vest again . But the process can be gru@@ eling .
One of the patients described it as " painful . " Sean Anderson Cor@@ ona , 13 , under@@ went stem cell therapy when he was diagnosed with St@@ age 4 Neuro@@ bla@@ st@@ oma - a cancer often found in the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands . The boy was ho@@ oked up to machines for a day@@ long process that collec@@ ts the stem cells from the blood . The blood is then re@@ inf@@ used back into the body .
" I would try to sleep and my body would just start shaking , and then I just started to fre@@ ak out and I 'd start crying , " Cor@@ ona told AB@@ C-@@ 7 .
Cor@@ ona will be canc@@ er-@@ free for three years in November . But his mother , Elizabeth Anderson , said that she worries that if his cancer does return , it may be impossible to har@@ vest more stem cells from his blood .
Stein said that the rec@@ olle@@ ction of patients " stem cells would only be recommended in the event that they are needed in the event that the patient rel@@ ap@@ ses .
" We think that 's going to be incredibly unlikely so we wouldn 't ask anyone to do that in advance , " he said .
The free@@ zer has since been replaced , and the sen@@ sor@@ -@@ monitoring and alert system have been up@@ graded .
" Obviously , this is a huge deal for us . " Stein said . " We 're reaching out directly to every single family in person to make sure that all their questions are answered . "
Prince Harry walks across Ang@@ ol@@ an min@@ ef@@ ield to re@@ connect with Princ@@ es Diana 's legacy
It 's day six of the Duke of Sussex ' royal tour of Africa with his wife Meghan and baby Archie . But Friday morning , Harry returned to Angola alone to re@@ connect with the legacy of his late mother , Princess Diana .
Diana 's legacy was brought full circle when Harry don@@ ned the distinc@@ tive blue body arm@@ or of the H@@ AL@@ O Trust . Tw@@ enty-@@ two years ago , Diana took a similar path across an Ang@@ ol@@ an field sc@@ attered with deadly land@@ mines , left over from years of civil war . It became one of the most iconic images of her short life .
We@@ aring protective body arm@@ or and a visor , Diana , Princess of Wales , visits a min@@ ef@@ ield being cleared by the charity Hal@@ o in Hu@@ amb@@ o , Angola , January 15 , 1997 .
She was campaigning to rid the world of this weapon of war , but never lived to see her success , dying just months before an international treaty banned land@@ mines in December 1997 .
Over two decades later , the world is still not free of these devices . And echo@@ ing his mother , loud and clear , Prince Harry de@@ ton@@ ated a recently detected mine .
" Land@@ mines are an un@@ he@@ aled sc@@ ar of war , " Prince Harry said . " By cle@@ aring the land@@ mines we can help this community find peace , and with peace comes opportunity . "

Thomas Cook pension tru@@ ste@@ es plot deal to sal@@ vage pay@@ outs
Thomas Cook 's pension funds have kicked off talks with specialist insur@@ ers about a deal to sal@@ vage the collapsed travel group 's retirement scheme benefits .
Sky News has learnt that Steve Southern , chair of the tru@@ ste@@ es , is holding talks with several parties about a bu@@ y@@ out deal that would avoid most of Thomas Cook 's 14@@ ,000 pension scheme members facing a steep cut to their payments .
Any deal with an insur@@ er would be likely to involve a more modest cut to pay@@ outs than the 10 % triggered by a pension scheme 's transfer into the Pen@@ sion Protection Fund ( PP@@ F ) life@@ boat .
The discussions are at a very preliminary stage and - even if successful - will not result in a deal until after the Thomas Cook schemes have been through an assessment by the PP@@ F .
Thomas Cook bosses face investigation into what led to collapse
That period could take up to two years , and if the schemes do enter the PP@@ F will result in roughly 10,000 future pension@@ ers having their pay@@ outs cut by 10 % .
Sour@@ ces said that a number of pension risk transfer speci@@ alists , as well as at least one of the new " super@@ fund " consoli@@ dation vehicles , were in talks with Thomas Cook 's tru@@ ste@@ es about a deal .
News of the tru@@ ste@@ es ' efforts to secure members ' benefits comes four days after Britain 's oldest tour operator ce@@ ased trading , spar@@ king an international re@@ patri@@ ation programme and trig@@ gering thousands of job losses .
Thomas Cook 's des@@ cent into in@@ solven@@ cy has sparked a bitter blame game , with board members , government ministers and au@@ dit@@ ors all facing demands to explain their actions in the months before its collapse .
The company 's four pension schemes are well-@@ funded , with a £ 100m sur@@ plus on a PP@@ F basis , according to the latest figures .
Colle@@ c@@ tively , they hold assets worth about £ 1.5@@ bn .
However , as Sky News revealed last month , the tru@@ ste@@ es ' demands for better terms in Thomas Cook 's proposed rescue deal added a further complic@@ ation to efforts to get the transaction across the line .
Thomas Cook 's liqu@@ id@@ ation brought to an end 17@@ 8 years of sol@@ vent trading , prompting the launch of in@@ quiries by the government 's In@@ solven@@ cy Service , the accounting watchdog and an influential committee of MPs .
Ministers have established a t@@ as@@ k@@ force to address the crisis , which has left credit@@ ors facing me@@ ag@@ re returns from the post-@@ in@@ solven@@ cy sale of assets .
To date , just under half of Thomas Cook 's overseas British customers have been flown home .
Its collapse came hours after Thomas Cook issued a last-@@ gas@@ p plea to its lenders to reduce a £ 200@@ m funding demand .
What went so wrong for Thomas Cook ?
The talks , which concluded without a deal on Sunday evening , represented a fran@@ tic last throw of the di@@ ce for a company which had been forced to seek more than £ 1@@ bn in new funding following a £ 1.5@@ bn half-@@ year loss and deterior@@ ating trading .
Thomas Cook was founded in 18@@ 41 by a 32@@ -year-old c@@ abin@@ et-@@ maker and former Bap@@ t@@ ist pre@@ acher who began offering one-@@ day rail ex@@ cur@@ sions from Leicester to Lou@@ gh@@ borough for a sh@@ illing .
From there , it went on to become one of the world 's largest holiday companies , marking its 17@@ 5@@ th anniversary three years ago .
A PP@@ F spokesperson said : " In@@ solven@@ cy events , like the liqu@@ id@@ ation of Thomas Cook , are exactly why the PP@@ F was set up .
" We are here to protect the financial futures of members belong@@ ing to defined benefit pension schemes and they should take comfort knowing we are here to protect them . "
A spokesman for Thomas Cook 's pension tru@@ ste@@ es declined to comment on Friday .
Ad@@ or@@ able pictures show new@@ -@@ born r@@ hin@@ o nu@@ zz@@ ling her mother and exploring new home
Baby Stella was welcomed into the world at Co@@ ts@@ w@@ old Wildlife Park , Ox@@ fordshire , earlier this month and is the first female born to parents Mon@@ ty and Ruby .
The young@@ ster , who is healthy and nursing well , can be seen wondering about her en@@ closure before re@@ sting alongside her mother on a bed of stra@@ w .
Mother Ruby joined the wildlife park in 2009 alongside another female called Nancy in the hope that one would produce the park 's first ever calf with Mon@@ ty .
Nancy then gave birth to a female named A@@ stri@@ d in 2013 , with Stella being the third female calf born at the park in its 4@@ 9-@@ year history .
Jamie Craig , cur@@ ator of Co@@ ts@@ w@@ old Wildlife Park , said : ' We have had tremendous success with our current r@@ hin@@ o her@@ d .
'@@ Stella is the sixth young@@ ster from Nancy and Ruby and our bull , Mon@@ ty , has proved to be an excellent dad .
'He is the perfect combination of a dominant bull and caring patri@@ arch .
'It is particularly satis@@ fying that Ruby has produced a female calf - these are vital for the development of the bre@@ eding programme and Stella will eventually move to another collection to hopefully become a successful mother herself . ' 
Ruby has had two boys before , Ian in 2015 and Alan in 2017 . Alan is still at the park whilst Ian is in Tor@@ ino Zoo in Italy
When Alan was just one-@@ week old he weighed around el@@ even stone .
Bir@@ ths in cap@@ tivity are considered extremely rare . Fem@@ ales only re@@ produce every two-@@ and-a-@@ half to five years , so the window of opportunity for successful re@@ production is limited .
According to the park , a typical gest@@ ation period la@@ sts between six@@ teen to eigh@@ teen months , after which a single calf is born .
It is considered the longest gest@@ ation periods of any land m@@ amm@@ al , sur@@ passed only by the tw@@ enty-@@ two month gest@@ ation period of an Ele@@ ph@@ ant .
A new@@ born R@@ hin@@ o calf will stand up within one hour of birth . Once born , the calf will immediately attempt to su@@ ckle , although he or she may be a little un@@ steady on their feet for the first few days .

In@@ cel vir@@ gin Alex Min@@ assi@@ an told Toronto police he was part of 4@@ chan group
Foot@@ age has emerged of a man alleged to have killed 10 pedestri@@ ans in Toronto telling police that he was part of an online group for sexually frustrated men .
Ale@@ k Min@@ assi@@ an , 26 , said that he was part of the invol@@ un@@ tary cel@@ ib@@ ates ( inc@@ el ) forum on 4@@ chan .
He is now facing 10 counts of murder in Canada and 16 counts of attempted murder following the attack on April 23 , 2018 .
When asked about the deaths , he told police : " I feel like I accompl@@ ished my mission . "
When the incident happened , it brought attention to the online world of lon@@ el@@ iness , rage and mis@@ og@@ yn@@ y .
Min@@ assi@@ an said that he had contact with a killer in California who was angry at women who had rejected him .
He stands accused of driving a rental van into crowds of pedestri@@ ans in a busy north Toronto neighbour@@ hood . Eight women and two men ranging in age from 22 to 94 died .
Min@@ assi@@ an has yet to enter a plea . His trial begins in February , but a publication ban on his inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation by police was lifted today . The police interview took place just hours after the attack .
Min@@ assi@@ an , who said he never had a girlfriend and was a vir@@ gin , acknowledged he used the van as a weapon and said he wanted to inspire more attacks .
He said : " I know of several other guys over the internet who feel the same way , " but added that they are " too co@@ war@@ dly to act on their anger . "
Min@@ assi@@ an calls himself an " inc@@ el , " short for " invol@@ un@@ tary cel@@ ib@@ ate . " The inc@@ el movement is an online sub@@ culture linked to the deadly attack in Toronto as well as attacks in California and Florida . It promo@@ tes the mis@@ og@@ yn@@ istic idea that men are entitled to have sex with women .
Over time , " inc@@ el " has become a bu@@ zz@@ word for certain men inf@@ uri@@ ated at being rejected by women and pr@@ one to flo@@ at ideas for violent pay@@ back , according to soci@@ ologists and others who study them .
Lik@@ e-@@ minded people in internet for@@ ums sometimes use " Chad " and " St@@ acy " as dis@@ mis@@ sive s@@ lang for men and women with more active sex lives .
Min@@ assi@@ an said he discussed his sexual frustr@@ ations on the website 4@@ chan , which has become notorious as a place for extrem@@ ists to post their views .
US theater chain bans dressing up for " Joker " screen@@ ings over fears of another shooting
The largest US independent theater chain won 't let people in co@@ spl@@ ay watch the critically accla@@ imed origin story of Bat@@ man super@@ vil@@ lain " Joker . " Face paint and masks are already banned , but safety fears still remain .
Most US cinemas have banned masks , face paint and toy weapons after the 2012 mass shooting in Aur@@ ora , Colorado , which happened during a screening of another Bat@@ man fli@@ ck , " The Dark Knight Ris@@ es . " The gunman wore a Joker cost@@ ume when he went on a gun and te@@ ar-@@ gas ramp@@ age , killing 12 people and inj@@ uring 70 others . Body co@@ stum@@ es that don 't hide a person 's identity , however , have been generally allowed in theaters .
However , Land@@ mark The@@ aters has now announced that it will not allow customers to wear co@@ stum@@ es during screen@@ ings of the R-@@ rated " Joker . "
" I want customers to be comfortable in their surro@@ und@@ ings , " Land@@ mark Pre@@ sident@@ -@@ CEO Ted Mund@@ or@@ ff told the Hollywood Reporter .
The company is based in Lo@@ s-@@ Angeles and runs 52 theaters in 27 markets , which makes it the biggest speci@@ alized theater chain in the country .
Meanwhile , K@@ ans@@ as@@ -based AMC Theat@@ res , the largest chain in the country , reiterated its ban on " masks , face paint or any object that conce@@ als the face , " but said they will welcome viewers in cost@@ ume .
The ban on masks and fake guns was mostly due to practical security reasons , but as the release of " Joker " draws closer , there are concerns that it may trigger a cop@@ y@@ cat gun attack . The LA@@ PD said it would " maintain high vis@@ ibility " around theaters on premier day , while Reg@@ al Cinem@@ as , the second-@@ largest chain in the country , said it was implementing security protocols developed " in collaboration with NATO . "
The US Army went as far as advis@@ ing service members to watch out for " inc@@ els , " disgr@@ un@@ t@@ led m@@ ales who can 't get a date , who sup@@ pose@@ dly i@@ do@@ li@@ ze the Joker and may m@@ im@@ ic his brutal ways .
" Joker , " which is directed by Todd Phillips and stars Joaqu@@ in Phoenix as the title character , is due to be released on October 4 in the US , and is expected to become a box office hit . It follows the des@@ cent of a socially isolated and mentally un@@ well person , as he becomes the mass@@ -@@ mur@@ dering , gre@@ en-@@ ha@@ ired , pal@@ e-@@ faced ne@@ mes@@ is of Bat@@ man .
It received ra@@ ve reviews at its Venice International Film Festival premiere this year , taking the top prize . The film is a psychological thriller loo@@ sely based on the comic book series . Some comment@@ ers voiced concerns that it may cause harm by depic@@ ting the pro@@ tagon@@ ist in a sympath@@ etic way and including graphic and realistic violence . However , the creative team behind it said their work is meant for mature audiences who are expected to be able to tell right from wrong .
Mid@@ way Broad@@ casting announced today that its Chair@@ woman , Mel@@ ody Sp@@ ann Cooper is set to release her highly anticipated book to help female entreprene@@ urs and executives thrive in business . " The Gir@@ l@@ friend 's Guide To C@@ losing the Deal " shares insi@@ ghts on how women can use their voice to achieve equity at the negotiating table and advance their careers by using the female edition of the old-@@ boy 's network .
Throughout the book , Sp@@ ann Cooper uses an@@ ec@@ do@@ tal refer@@ ences to deal with challenging issues including the # MeToo movement and Hillary Clinton 's Presidential defeat and its impact on fu@@ eling the female empower@@ ment in America .
The self-@@ published book is the result of a ground@@ breaking self-@@ entitled speech that Sp@@ ann Cooper delivered as a key@@ note address at The National Association of Women Business O@@ wners Conference in Chicago in 2017 . The Gir@@ l@@ friend 's Guide to C@@ losing The Deal is written in a down-@@ to-@@ earth style that every " girlfriend " can relate .
Christie H@@ ef@@ ner , business@@ woman and daughter of Play@@ boy Fo@@ under , Hugh H@@ ef@@ ner , says " The Gir@@ l@@ friend 's Guide to C@@ losing The Deal " is both highly entertaining and very helpful . Mel@@ ody we@@ aves together personal an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes , triumph@@ s , and set@@ backs with useful lessons learned . From how to own your ideas in a meeting to when its time to " friend up , " everyone can benefit from Mel@@ ody 's story . "
As Chairman of Mid@@ way Broad@@ casting Corporation , she joined an elite list of America 's female broadcast owners after purch@@ asing the company 's controlling interest in 1999 . Mid@@ way Broad@@ casting Corporation is a best@@ -in-@@ class female and fam@@ il@@ y-@@ owned media bou@@ ti@@ que whose properties include radio and inter@@ active platforms .
The book was co-@@ written with T. Sha@@ wn Taylor , journalist , writer and founder of Tree Top Consul@@ ting , a full-@@ service media consulting firm .
Rom@@ ania Invest@@ s B@@ illions in a Black Sea Military Base
Rom@@ ania will spend 2.5 billion euros to modern@@ ize the Black Sea military base as part of counter@@ acting Russia 's growing presence in the region , according to The Times , quoted by the FO@@ C@@ US News Agency . Mik@@ hail K@@ og@@ li@@ gn@@ ich@@ anu Air@@ base , located about 200 k@@ m. east of Buch@@ arest , will be aligned with NATO standards , as evi@@ den@@ ced by documents published by local news sites . Up to 10,000 NATO F-@@ 35 soldiers and aircraft can be accommod@@ ated there . It is planned to become a " min@@ i-@@ city " for the military with kin@@ der@@ gar@@ tens , sports clubs and a hospital .
The base has already become a center of increased NATO activity in the Black Sea , which has become a key area of tension between Russia and the West . After Moscow an@@ ne@@ xed Cri@@ me@@ a from Ukraine in 2014 , the Kremlin began to increase its nav@@ al presence in the Black Sea , using the deep@@ -@@ sea base in Se@@ v@@ ast@@ op@@ ol to carry out nav@@ al missions in Syria . Russia is also ham@@ per@@ ing shipping in the region and last year captured three Ukrainian ships in the Ker@@ ch Stra@@ it .
Rom@@ ania and Bulgaria , located on the Black Sea coast , which in the past were allies of the US@@ S@@ R , have joined NATO and the EU since its collapse . In response to Russia 's actions , they have asked the alliance to strengthen its presence in the region , writes The Times . In February , 500 US troops arrived at Rom@@ ania 's air base . An Euro@@ fighter Typ@@ ho@@ on fighter squ@@ ad@@ ron of the British Air Force is station@@ ed and deployed . Since April last year , these aircraft have repeatedly inter@@ cep@@ ted Russian fighter jets . Georgia , located on the eastern Black Sea coast , is also concerned about Russia 's aspir@@ ations . It is not a member of the alliance , but is involved in NATO military exercises . NATO Secretary General J@@ ens Stol@@ ten@@ berg said during a visit to T@@ bil@@ isi in March that the alliance was " preparing " Georgia for acc@@ ession . Ukraine has also participated in NATO exercises in the region and has been developing its engagement with the Union since 2014 .
Ukraine , the " New Berlin Wall , " Once Again L@@ ies at the Center of Sc@@ andal
Mr. Por@@ o@@ sh@@ enko 's eag@@ ern@@ ess to win over Mr. Trump and his growing fears that political rivals would th@@ wart his re-election opened the way for Mr. Giuliani to press Ukraine 's prosecutor general , Y@@ uri Lut@@ sen@@ ko , who has since been fired , to help Mr. Trump 's own re-election by investigating Joe Biden and his son .
How Mr. Por@@ o@@ sh@@ enko expected the Trump administration to help lift his sag@@ ging fortun@@ es ahead of Ukraine 's presidential election , held in two rounds in March and April this year , is unclear . He got tro@@ unced anyway , losing emph@@ atically to Mr. Zelensky , whose own officials quickly became the Trump team 's new targets in its drive to damage Mr. Biden .
While Democrats want Mr. Trump impe@@ ached over his deal@@ ings with Ukraine , the president and his allies have counter@@ attacked with their own Ukra@@ ine-@@ focused sc@@ andals . They have revi@@ ved a deb@@ un@@ ked theory that the country col@@ lu@@ ded with the Clinton campaign to hurt Mr. Trump 's chances in 2016 and asser@@ ted , with little evidence , that Mr. Biden used his position as vice president to prevent Ukraine from investigating his son .
Ukra@@ inians , j@@ aded after years of watching their own leaders trade the power and privileg@@ es of office for personal financial or political gain , have mostly shr@@ ug@@ ged off what , for Mr. Trump , is possibly the most serious scandal to bu@@ ff@@ et the White House since Wat@@ erg@@ ate top@@ pled President Richard Nixon in 1974 .
That a country few Americans paid much attention to in the past now comm@@ ands center stage in Washington has stir@@ red mostly be@@ mu@@ sement in Ukraine . Those feelings are also t@@ inged with a touch of pride that , after centuries in the shadow of Russia , its giant neighbor to the north , the nation is no longer seen as a back@@ water but a pi@@ vo@@ t around which the fate of the world 's most powerful country im@@ plau@@ sibly turns .
Pav@@ lo Klim@@ kin , Ukraine 's foreign minister under Mr. Por@@ o@@ sh@@ enko , said in a cau@@ stic Twitter message this week that going down in history " as the country that led to the impeachment of the U.S. president " was " not a very fun prospect . " But , he added , " Now everyone understands what we are capable of . "
Brother J@@ ailed For Life For Pakistan Social Media Star Q@@ an@@ de@@ el Bal@@ o@@ ch 's Hon@@ our K@@ illing
Q@@ an@@ de@@ el Bal@@ o@@ ch , who shot to fame for her social media photos , was stran@@ gled in July 2016 .
The brother of Pakistani social media star Q@@ an@@ de@@ el Bal@@ o@@ ch was on Friday convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison in the patri@@ arch@@ al country 's hig@@ he@@ st-@@ profile " honour killing . "
Bal@@ o@@ ch , who shot to fame for her ris@@ que sel@@ fies -- t@@ ame by Western standards , but considered provoc@@ ative in deeply mis@@ og@@ yn@@ istic Pakistan -- was stran@@ gled in July 2016 .
Her brother Muhammad Was@@ eem was arrested . Days later he told a press conference that he had no re@@ mor@@ se over what he did , saying that " of course " he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour had been " in@@ toler@@ able . "
His lawyer , Sar@@ dar Meh@@ mood , told AFP the court in the eastern city of Mul@@ tan had found his client guilty and sentenced him to life impris@@ onment , in a long-@@ a@@ waited verdict .
" In@@ sh@@ all@@ ah ( God willing ) , he will be acqu@@ itted by a high court , " he said .
Earlier , Bal@@ o@@ ch 's mother An@@ war Mai told AFP she had hoped her son would be acqu@@ itted .
" He is innocent . She was my daughter and he is my son , " she said .
Bal@@ o@@ ch 's murder made international headlines and re@@ ign@@ ited calls for action against an epidemic of so-called " honour killings , " in which a victim -- usually a woman -- is murdered for fl@@ outing patri@@ arch@@ al social codes .
Women have been burned , shot , stabbed and stran@@ gled for offences such as choosing their own husband or -- in Bal@@ o@@ ch 's case -- bringing " shame " on their family by celebrating their sexuality .
The killings are usually carried out by a close relative . Under Pakistan 's Q@@ is@@ as ( blood money ) and Di@@ y@@ at ( re@@ tribu@@ tion ) law , they can then seek for@@ gi@@ veness from a victim 's relatives .
Three months after Bal@@ o@@ ch 's murder , parliament passed new legislation mand@@ ating life impris@@ onment for honour killings .
However , whether a murder is defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge 's discre@@ tion , meaning that kill@@ ers can theo@@ re@@ tically claim a different mo@@ tive and still be par@@ don@@ ed .
In Bal@@ o@@ ch 's case , her parents initially insisted their son would be given no absol@@ ution .
But , heart@@ broken at the thought of losing him also , they changed their minds and said they wanted him to be for@@ given .
International re@@ vul@@ sion at the killing had seen the Pakistani state take the unprecedented step of declaring itself an h@@ eir alongside the parents , however , forcing the case to move ahead .
Some of Bal@@ o@@ ch 's bet@@ ter-@@ known actions included offering to perform a stri@@ p@@ te@@ ase for the Pakistani cricket team , and don@@ ning a plung@@ ing scar@@ let dress on Valent@@ ine 's Day .
She attracted criticism and threats but was perceived by many , including young people , as breaking new ground in a country where presenting yourself as a Kim Kardash@@ i@@ an-@@ like figure can be seen as a bold , political act of women 's empower@@ ment .
The roots of " honour " killings lie in trib@@ al social norms , which remain preval@@ ent across South Asia and dict@@ ate the behaviour of women in particular , though men can be victims too .
Three Scottish students named among Europe 's best
Three University of Dundee students have been named regional winners as top gradu@@ ates in Europe .
The University of Dundee students were named as top gradu@@ ates in their respective fields in Europe in the 2019 Global Under@@ graduate Awards , whilst five other students from the same university were praised by the judges .
Scott Shel@@ drick , who gradu@@ ated in Mol@@ ec@@ ular Gen@@ e@@ tics , won the Europe award for Life Sciences , Che@@ ster Corn@@ ford studied MS@@ c Mental Health Nur@@ sing and was awarded the Nur@@ sing , Mid@@ wi@@ fer@@ y & Al@@ lied Healthcare prize , whilst L@@ ola Kn@@ ib@@ b won the Vis@@ ual Arts award .
Although all three made it through to the global final , they lost out in the final round to strong competition from some of the 3,@@ 500 ent@@ rants from across the world .
Professor Blair G@@ rub@@ b , Vic@@ e-@@ Prin@@ cipal ( Education ) at the University , said : " To get to this stage , our students and gradu@@ ates faced competition from peers attending some of the world 's top universities .
" The Under@@ graduate Awards are fier@@ c@@ ely contested by thousands of students around the world and it is a great reflection of the quality of our students , and the education they receive here , that Dundee is so strongly represented amongst the prize winners .
" I would like to offer my warm@@ est congratul@@ ations to Scott , Che@@ ster and L@@ ola on this fantastic achievement , alongside the other Dundee representatives who were highly commen@@ ded . "
Another five students were commen@@ ded in the world 's leading under@@ graduate awards programme , which recogn@@ ises top work completed by under@@ gradu@@ ates to share this with a global audience .
In@@ clu@@ ded in the five praised students were Nicholas Gallagher and James Os@@ bourne ( both Life Sciences ) , Fer@@ en@@ c Koh@@ su@@ ke I@@ sh@@ ik@@ awa Gut@@ ai ( Medicine ) , Cait@@ lyn Scott ( An@@ atom@@ ical Sciences ) and W@@ aco Y@@ ok@@ o@@ y@@ ama ( Philosoph@@ y ) .
The competition further celebrates top under@@ graduate cour@@ se@@ work and helps create collabor@@ ations between students and recent gradu@@ ates worldwide .
Old@@ est gal@@ ax@@ y proto@@ cluster forms ' queen 's court@@ '
Using the Sub@@ ar@@ u , K@@ eck , and Gem@@ ini Teles@@ cop@@ es , an international team of astron@@ omers has discovered a collection of 12 gal@@ ax@@ ies which existed about 13.@@ 0 billion years ago . This is the earliest proto@@ cluster ever found . One of the 12 gal@@ ax@@ ies is a giant object , known as Him@@ iko , which was discovered a decade ago by the Sub@@ ar@@ u Teles@@ cope and named for a myth@@ ological queen in ancient Japan . This discovery suggests that large structures such as proto@@ clu@@ sters already existed when the Uni@@ verse was only about 800 million years old , 6 percent of its present age .
In the present Uni@@ verse , gal@@ ax@@ y clu@@ sters can contain hundreds of members , but how these clu@@ sters form is a big question in astron@@ omy . To understand the formation of clu@@ sters , astron@@ omers search for possible pro@@ gen@@ itors in the ancient Uni@@ verse . A proto@@ cluster is a den@@ se system of dozens of gal@@ ax@@ ies in the early Uni@@ verse , growing into a cluster .
Yu@@ ich@@ i Har@@ ikan@@ e , a J@@ SP@@ S fellow at the National Astron@@ om@@ ical Observ@@ atory of Japan who led the team of astron@@ omers explains , " A proto@@ cluster is a rare and special system with an extremely high den@@ sity , and not easy to find . To overcome this problem , we used the wide field of view of the Sub@@ ar@@ u Teles@@ cope to map a large area of the sky and look for proto@@ clu@@ sters . "
In the map of the Uni@@ verse made by the Sub@@ ar@@ u Teles@@ cope , the team discovered a proto@@ cluster candidate , z@@ 66@@ O@@ D , where gal@@ ax@@ ies are 15 times more concentr@@ ated than normal for that era . The team then conducted fol@@ low-up spec@@ tro@@ sc@@ opic ob@@ servations using the W@@ .@@ M. K@@ eck Observ@@ atory and Gem@@ ini North tel@@ es@@ cope , and confirmed 12 gal@@ ax@@ ies which existed 13.@@ 0 billion years ago , making it the earliest proto@@ cluster known to date .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , one of the 12 gal@@ ax@@ ies in z@@ 66@@ O@@ D was a giant object with a huge body of gas , known as Him@@ iko , which was found previously by the Sub@@ ar@@ u Teles@@ cope in 2009 . " It is reasonable to find a proto@@ cluster near a massive object , such as Him@@ iko . However , we 're surprised to see that Him@@ iko was located not in the center of the proto@@ cluster , but on the edge 500 million ligh@@ t-@@ years away from the center . " said Mas@@ ami Ou@@ chi , a team member at the National Astron@@ om@@ ical Observ@@ atory of Japan and the University of Tokyo , who discovered Him@@ iko in 2009 . Iron@@ ically , the myth@@ ological queen Him@@ iko is also said to have lived clo@@ ist@@ ered away from her people . Ou@@ chi continues , " It is still not understood why Him@@ iko is not located in the center . These results will be a key for understanding the relationship between clu@@ sters and massive gal@@ ax@@ ies . "
Nancy Pelosi is subject of book by daughter Christine Pelosi
An upcoming book on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi comes from someone who knows her well , daughter Christine Pelosi .
" The Nancy Pelosi Way " will be released Nov. 26 , Sky@@ horse Publ@@ ishing announced Thursday . Christine Pelosi 's book will examine how a mother of five became the first female house speaker and her current leadership of House Democrats during the Trump administration . According to Sky@@ horse , Christine Pelosi will we@@ ave together " the professional and personal experiences " of her mother .
Christine Pelosi is a Democratic Party strategist and author of " Campaign Boot Camp " and " Campaign Boot Camp 2.@@ 0 . " Pelosi 's sister , Alexandra Pelosi , is a film@@ maker and journalist who has made several docum@@ ent@@ aries about contemporary politics .
Warren 's le@@ mon@@ ade money went to a pro-@@ life charity
When Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D. , Mass . ) purchased drinks from two girls running a le@@ mon@@ ade stand in August , she may not have been aware that her $ 10 purchase would be donated to a pro-@@ life charity .
" Our daughters thought [ Warren ] was nice , " Dan Mich@@ els , a Trump supporter and a father to one of the girls , told the Washington Free Be@@ ac@@ on . " She came by and told us we should vote for her . And our daughters told us she was a nice person , but we don 't al@@ ign with her politically and ... because she 's pro-@@ choice , we said we should donate her money to a pro-@@ life [ cause ] . "
On August 8 , Warren stopped by a le@@ mon@@ ade stand staff@@ ed by two 11@@ -year-old children , Si@@ enna Mich@@ els and Au@@ dre@@ y Bill@@ ings , during a campaign bus tour across Iowa .
" St@@ opped for a quick drink at a le@@ mon@@ ade stand in Har@@ lan , Iowa . When life gives you le@@ m@@ ons , make big structural change ! " Warren said on Twitter .
The two kids were excited about meeting a presidential candidate in person . The Mich@@ els girl urged her parents to vote for the Massachusetts senator in 2020 after the photo op . The parents instead explained Warren 's stance on abortion . The girls and their parents decided to donate to the March for Life Education and Defense Fund , a non-@@ profit that supports pro-@@ life legislation .
" My daughter told us she wanted us to vote for her , " Mich@@ els said . " We talked about the abortion part of things and said maybe we should donate money to stop abortion , and my daughter was all for that . "
Why viruses like Her@@ pes and Z@@ ika will need to be rec@@ las@@ si@@ fied : Bio@@ tech impact
New research reveals that the way viruses were perceived in terms of their architecture will need to be re@@ to@@ ol@@ ed , because they are actually struc@@ tured in many more patterns than previously understood . The findings could have significant impact on how they are classified , our understanding of how they form , evol@@ ve and inf@@ ect hosts , and strategies to identify ways to design vaccines to target them .
In the 1950s and ' 60s as scientists began to obtain high resolution images of viruses , they discovered the detailed structure of the cap@@ si@@ d -- an ou@@ ter protective layer com@@ posed of multiple copies of the same protein -- which protec@@ ts the virus ' genetic material . The majority of viruses have cap@@ si@@ ds that are typically qu@@ as@@ i-@@ sp@@ her@@ ical and display ic@@ o@@ sa@@ he@@ dr@@ al sym@@ met@@ ry -- like a 20-@@ sided di@@ ce for instance .
The cap@@ si@@ d shell is what protec@@ ts them , and as scientists discovered their structure , they proposed that cap@@ si@@ ds could have different sizes and hold different amounts of gen@@ ome , and therefore could inf@@ ect hosts differently .
Why this matters
When desig@@ ning drugs to target viruses , scientists can now take their var@@ ying structural sha@@ pes into account to improve eff@@ ic@@ acy .
Two researchers who study the structures of viruses , Anton@@ i Lu@@ que , a theo@@ reti@@ cal bi@@ op@@ hy@@ si@@ c@@ ist at San Diego State University and a member of its Vir@@ al Information Institute , and Rei@@ du@@ n T@@ war@@ ock , a ma@@ themati@@ cal bi@@ ologist from the University of York , UK , and a member of York 's Cros@@ s-@@ disciplinary Centre for Systems Analysis , show that many viruses have essentially been mis@@ classified for 60 years , including common viruses such as Her@@ pes simp@@ le@@ x and Z@@ ika .
This was because despite having the structural images from cr@@ yo@@ -@@ elec@@ tr@@ on micro@@ sc@@ opy , we did not have the ma@@ themati@@ cal description of many of the architec@@ tures of different viruses .
" We discovered six new ways in which proteins can organiz@@ e to form ic@@ o@@ sa@@ he@@ dr@@ al cap@@ si@@ d sh@@ ells , " Lu@@ que said . " So , many viruses don 't adopt only the two broadly understood cap@@ si@@ d architec@@ tures . There are now at least eight ways in which their ic@@ o@@ sa@@ he@@ dr@@ al cap@@ si@@ ds could be designed . "
They used a gener@@ alization of the qu@@ as@@ ie@@ qu@@ ival@@ ence principle to see how proteins can wrap around an ic@@ o@@ sa@@ he@@ dr@@ al cap@@ si@@ d .
Their study , which will be published in Nature Communications on Friday , September 27 , also shows that viruses that are part of the same structural line@@ age , based on the protein that they 're com@@ posed of , adopt consistent ic@@ o@@ sa@@ he@@ dr@@ al cap@@ si@@ d lay@@ outs , providing a new approach to study virus evolution .
Bio@@ tech applications
Stru@@ c@@ tural bi@@ ologists can now take this information and rec@@ las@@ si@@ fy the structure of the viruses , which will help unvei@@ l molec@@ ular and evol@@ ution@@ ary relationships between different viruses .
It will also provide a guide to engineer new molec@@ ular contain@@ ers for n@@ ano@@ tech and bio@@ tech applications , and it will help scientists to identify specific strategies to target the assembly of proteins in the cap@@ si@@ d . This can eventually lead to a more system@@ atic approach to developing an@@ tiv@@ ir@@ al vaccines .
" We can use this discovery to target both the assembly and stability of the cap@@ si@@ d , to either prevent the formation of the virus when it inf@@ ects the host cell , or break it apart after it 's formed , " Lu@@ que said . " This could facilitate the character@@ ization and identi@@ fication of an@@ tiv@@ ir@@ al targets for viruses sharing the same ic@@ o@@ sa@@ he@@ dr@@ al lay@@ out . "
This new framework accommod@@ ates viruses that were previously out@@ liers , provides new predic@@ tions of viral cap@@ si@@ d architec@@ tures , and has identified common ge@@ omet@@ rical patterns among distant evol@@ ution@@ ary related viruses that inf@@ ect everyone from humans to bacteria .
T@@ war@@ ock said the new blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints also provide " a new perspective on viral evolution , suggesting novel routes in which larger and more complex viruses may have evolved from simple ones at evol@@ ution@@ ary tim@@ es@@ c@@ ales . "
Archit@@ ec@@ tural applications
The ge@@ omet@@ ries could be also used in new architec@@ tural designs in buildings and construction .
Since the 1960s , these viral cap@@ si@@ ds have been classified using the ge@@ omet@@ rical framework introduced by structural bi@@ ologist Donald Cas@@ par and bi@@ op@@ hy@@ si@@ c@@ ist Aaron K@@ lug , which were inspired by the ge@@ o@@ des@@ ic dom@@ es designed by the renowned architect R. Buck@@ min@@ ster Ful@@ ler . However , as molec@@ ular im@@ aging techniques have advanced , an increasing number of 3D viral cap@@ si@@ d re@@ construc@@ tions that included viruses like Her@@ pes or Z@@ ika have fallen out from this classi@@ cal ge@@ omet@@ rical framework .
" This study introduc@@ es a more general framework than the classic Cas@@ par@@ -@@ K@@ lug construction . It is based on the conservation of the local ver@@ ti@@ ces formed by the proteins that interact in the cap@@ si@@ d , " Lu@@ que explained . " This approach led to the discovery of six new types of ic@@ o@@ sa@@ he@@ dr@@ al cap@@ si@@ d lay@@ outs , while recovering the two classi@@ cal lay@@ outs from Cas@@ par@@ -@@ K@@ lug based on Gold@@ berg and ge@@ o@@ des@@ ic poly@@ he@@ dra .

Pri@@ est who sexually abused boys in Wisconsin gets 30 years
A former pri@@ est accused of sexually assaul@@ ting young boys in Wisconsin decades ago has been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
The W@@ au@@ sa@@ u Daily Herald reports that 7@@ 2-year-old Thomas Eri@@ ck@@ sen received the maximum sentence Thursday on two charges of sexually assaul@@ ting young boys while station@@ ed at St. Peter 's Catholic Church in Winter in the late 70s and early 80s . He must register as a sex off@@ ender for life .
Four men testified Thursday about how the assaul@@ ts affected their lives . One of the victims went public for the first time .
Eri@@ ck@@ sen apologi@@ zed to the victims in court and said he has come to realize the impact the assaul@@ ts had on victims . At least 11 men claim they were abused by Eri@@ ck@@ sen during his time in the cl@@ ergy .
Eri@@ ck@@ sen was removed from the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood in 1988 .
Having Too Much Of This Sp@@ ice Could Dam@@ age Li@@ ver
Made from the inner bar@@ k of the C@@ inn@@ am@@ om@@ um tree , c@@ inn@@ am@@ on is a widely popular sp@@ ice , earning itself a place in a large variety of food and even becoming a fl@@ avor itself .
And all for good reason since the sp@@ ice is host to some very impressive health benefits , such as lower@@ ing the risk of life-@@ threatening diseases like heart disease , cancer and even diabetes .
But hold your horses just yet since too much of a good thing can be harmful , very harmful . And in this case , here are some side effects one can get if they eat too much c@@ inn@@ am@@ on . Stay safe out there .
May increase the risk of cancer - Unfortunately , while c@@ inn@@ am@@ on can help lower the risk of cancer , it can also very much contribute to the development of it . P@@ er animal studies , consum@@ ing too much cou@@ mar@@ in , which is commonly found in C@@ assi@@ a c@@ inn@@ am@@ on , may increase the risk of cancer development . P@@ er scientists , cou@@ mar@@ in does this by sup@@ pose@@ dly damaging our D@@ N@@ As over time .
May cause liver damage - P@@ er studies , too much cou@@ mar@@ in can also be responsible for liver tox@@ icity and damage . This is according to several studies made on the effects of too much cou@@ mar@@ in in our bodies .
May cause mouth so@@ res - Not only does too much c@@ inn@@ am@@ on help contribute to deadly conditions but they may also cause mouth so@@ res .

Tennessee 's abortion waiting period trial goes to judge
A federal judge will have to decide which experts to believe in a trial over Tennessee 's 48-@@ hour waiting period law for abor@@ tions .
Over the course of a four-@@ day trial in Nashville that concluded Thursday , the state tried to show that the law , which requires women to make two separate trips to a clinic at least 48 hours apart , benefits women by allowing them time to reflect on their decisions . Att@@ orneys representing five of the state 's seven abortion clinics argued the law provides no benefits and causes significant bur@@ dens .
Experts for both sides agreed that some women seeking abor@@ tions are uncertain , and some women who go through with an abortion later regret their decision . But they differ@@ ed on whether those constitu@@ ted a large or small percentage of the women seeking abor@@ tions . The experts also dis@@ agreed on whether Tennessee 's 48-@@ hour waiting period would make any difference for those women .
On Thursday , attorneys for the state introduced a study from Utah on the effects of a 7@@ 2-@@ hour waiting period there . It found that 8 % of participating women who attended an initial coun@@ selling visit later said they were no longer seeking an abortion .
Quest@@ ion@@ ed about the study , Anton@@ ia Big@@ gs , a social psych@@ ologist researcher at the University of California San Francisco , agreed that some women change their minds about having an abortion or are uncertain to begin with . But she noted that the study did not find that Utah 's mandatory waiting period caused women to change their minds or that it was otherwise beneficial to women .
Big@@ gs also testified that there is no evidence that abortion causes women to have mental health problems . She said a national study compar@@ ing women seeking abor@@ tions who were just under the cu@@ to@@ ff date to obtain them with a group of women who were over the cu@@ to@@ ff and were turned away from clinics found no difference in the rates of issues like depression and post-@@ traumatic stress .
Under cross-@@ examination Big@@ gs said the study did not follow the mental health outcomes of women in states with waiting periods who changed their minds about having an abortion , although there were only three women like that identified in the study . She re@@ but@@ ted testimony from earlier in the week by Pris@@ c@@ illa Coleman , a psych@@ ology professor at Bow@@ ling Green State University in Ohio , who said that abortion is associated with mental health problems .
Coleman testified that she believes most of the scientific literature on abortion is politically bi@@ ased in favor of abor@@ tions .
Thursday also included testimony for the state from a Memphis obst@@ et@@ ri@@ cian and gy@@ nec@@ ologist who particip@@ ates in a controversial network that attempts to halt the effects of abor@@ tion-@@ induc@@ ing medication . Dr. Michael Po@@ dra@@ za said that through that work he has " personal experience with women who have changed their minds about an abortion . "
Tennessee 's waiting period law went into effect in mid-@@ 2015 , and Po@@ dra@@ za said he has seen several women since then who wanted to try to reverse a medical abortion that was already underway . Some of those women then changed their minds a second time and followed through with the abortion , he testified . These revers@@ als happened in sp@@ ite of the waiting period .
Clinic directors previously testified the wait period causes women financial hard@@ ship and stress . They also said the two-@@ visit requirement poses log@@ ist@@ ical challenges for patients and clinics that cause abor@@ tions to be delayed far beyond the 48 hours required by law , pushing some women into surgical abor@@ tions , which have greater risks of complications . A few women are pushed beyond the time when they can receive an abortion altogether .
Tennessee is one of 14 states with laws requiring women to make two trips to an abortion clinic according to the Gut@@ t@@ macher Institute , a research group that supports abortion rights .
In determin@@ ing whether Tennessee 's waiting period viol@@ ates the U.S. Constitution , U.S. District Judge Bernard Fre@@ id@@ man must determine whether it places an un@@ due burden on women seeking abortion . It 's a sub@@ jec@@ tive standard that has caused some waiting period laws to be struck down and others up@@ held , depending on the specific circumstances of the state .
After both sides re@@ sted their cases on Thursday , Fried@@ man said he would rule as quickly as possible .
French chemical fire ext@@ ingu@@ ished as questions mount
French authorities and Nor@@ mand@@ y residents are cle@@ aring up resi@@ due from a huge fire at a chemical plant as a foul sten@@ ch continues to spread over a sw@@ ath of territory .
No one was injured in Thursday 's fire at a lu@@ bri@@ c@@ ant plant in Rou@@ en , but residents have expressed concern about possible health risks and consequences for the nearby Seine River .
The head of the regional administration said Friday the fire was ext@@ ingu@@ ished Thursday night after nearly 24 hours . Fi@@ refigh@@ ters are still on the scene .
The administration warned of a new o@@ dor released after the fire was put out , saying it could spread to neighboring regions .
Inter@@ ior Minister Christop@@ he Cast@@ aner said people in fragile health should remain indoors through Friday night .
The cause of the fire is being investigated . The plant is among the hig@@ he@@ st-@@ risk industrial sites in Europe .
L@@ NG investments hit record in 2019 & the biggest growth is coming from China
Invest@@ ments in li@@ que@@ fied natural gas since the start of the year have hit an all-time high of $ 50 billion , the International Energy Agency 's head , F@@ ati@@ h Bi@@ rol , told an industry conference .
" This year , 2019 already broke the highest amount of ( final investment decisions ) for the first time ever , $ 50 billion , " Bi@@ rol told the L@@ NG Produc@@ er-@@ Consumer conference in Tokyo , as quoted by Reuters .
Un@@ surprisingly , the driver of this growth in investments is growing demand for the fuel in Asia , with China still expected to over@@ take Japan as the world 's top impor@@ ter of L@@ NG .
" The biggest growth is coming from China . In the next five years , about one-@@ third of global L@@ NG demand will come from China alone , " Bi@@ rol said . He added that in five years , China will become the largest impor@@ ter of the fuel .
As for the growth in investments , there are no surpris@@ es there , either . The bulk of these has been made in the United States and Canada .
In a December 2018 report the Energy Information Administration said it expected the United States " L@@ NG export capacity to double by the end of this year to 8.@@ 9 billion cu ft daily . This will make the US the third-@@ largest expor@@ ter of L@@ NG in terms of capacity after Qatar and Australia . By 2030 , US L@@ NG exports are estimated to reach 17 billion cu ft daily , from some 3 billion cu ft at the start of 2019 .
In Canada , there is just one L@@ NG project under development right now - L@@ NG Canada - but it could have a final capacity of 28 million tons of the fuel annually . The US $ 31-@@ billion project is led by Shell , with minority participants including Pet@@ ron@@ as , Petro@@ China , Mit@@ sub@@ ishi , and K@@ og@@ as .
Meanwhile , Qatar is stepping up its efforts to keep its num@@ ber-@@ one spot in the global L@@ NG export race . The country has lifted a mor@@ atorium on new dr@@ illing in its North Field - the world 's largest off@@ shore gas field Qatar shares with Iran - aiming to boost export capacity by 43 percent to 11 million tons annually .
Global L@@ NG demand is seen at 5@@ 50 million tons by 2030 , according to proj@@ ections by I@@ HS Mark@@ it .

Leader of Colombia 's Los Pel@@ us@@ os crime gang killed , president says
The top leader and founder of Colombia 's Los Pel@@ us@@ os crime gang has been killed in an operation led by the national police , President Ivan Du@@ que said on Friday .
The gang is one of the most well-known criminal organizations in the An@@ de@@ an country and involved in fighting that has end@@ angered hundreds of thousands of people in areas along the eastern border with Venezuela .
Luis Antonio Qu@@ inter@@ o , known by his ali@@ as Pac@@ ora , was a former le@@ ft@@ ist re@@ bel who comm@@ anded some 4@@ 40 gang members , the government said .
The 49@@ -year-old was wanted on terrorism and murder charges and located in Nor@@ te de Sant@@ ander province on Thursday .
" It 's clear we are going to completely break up this group , " Du@@ que said in a statement from the United States , where he traveled for the United Nations General Assembly this week .
Qu@@ inter@@ o was responsible for the killings of human rights activists and community leaders , the statement added .
Du@@ que has faced criticism from some in the international community for not doing more to stop killings of activists from being committed with imp@@ unity across the country .
Another leader of Los Pel@@ us@@ os was captured in the operation , the statement added . It did not provide details about the circumstances of Qu@@ inter@@ o 's death .
'@@ How d@@ are you ? ' Thunberg 's U.N. speech inspi@@ res Dutch climate protesters
Thousands of Dutch children ski@@ pped school to join a global climate strike on Friday , blocking traffic and asking their leaders " how d@@ are you ? " in a reference to Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg 's speech at the United Nations .
A particip@@ ant holds a drawing depic@@ ting Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg during a protest march to call for action against climate change , in The H@@ ague , Netherlands September 27 , 2019 . REUTERS / Pi@@ ro@@ sch@@ ka van de W@@ ou@@ w
Turn@@ out at the march in The H@@ ague exc@@ eeded expectations with organizers estim@@ ating the crowd at about 3@@ 5,000 . Police were forced to r@@ er@@ ou@@ te the march to a location with more space .
Thunberg , 16 , gave an imp@@ assi@@ oned address at the United Nations in New York this week , after millions of people worldwide joined a climate strike protest last Friday in the run@@ -up to a U.N. climate summit .
" This strike is going to have a lot of effect when people keep showing up , not just today but also in the future and we see different kinds of people from all walks of life , " said protester Rein@@ der R@@ ust@@ ema .
Bang@@ ing d@@ rums and holding pictures of Thunberg , protesters walked through the city center with plac@@ ards reading : " For the Greta good , " " Don 't be a fossil f@@ ool , " and " You will die of old age , we will die of climate change . "
" I understand their concerns , I believe they are being heard , " Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rut@@ te told journalists at a weekly press briefing within ear@@ shot of the protests . " We have presented very ambitious plans to deal with these problems . But we have to do it in a smart way , which also creates jobs . "
Thunberg 's brief address electri@@ fied the start of the summit aimed at mobili@@ zing government and business to break international paraly@@ sis over carbon emissions , which hit record highs last year despite decades of warnings from scientists .
" This is all wrong . I shouldn 't be up here . I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope . How d@@ are you ? " she said , her voice qu@@ aver@@ ing with emotion .
The Netherlands , with 17 million in@@ habit@@ ants , generated less than 7 percent of all energy from sustainable sources in 2017 , compared to 15 percent in Germany and over half of all energy in Sweden .
The government has pledged to hal@@ ve CO2 emissions from 1990 levels by 2030 , but by 2017 had only achieved a 13 percent cut .
Thunberg was taking part in a protest in Canada on Friday where U.N. aviation leaders were gathering in Montreal to discuss plane emissions targets .
Military Se@@ es Fru@@ str@@ ating Trend As Su@@ icides Spi@@ ke
Military su@@ icides surged this year to a record high among active duty troops , continuing a deadly trend that Pentagon officials say is frustrating and they are struggling to counter .
The Army , Navy and Marine Corps all saw the rate of su@@ icides go up as well as the overall numbers , with only the Air Force showing a decrease , according to data released by the Pentagon Thursday . Su@@ icides among members of the Reser@@ ves and the National Guard also grew .
The difficulties involved in identifying service members with possible problems and finding ways to prevent su@@ icides were under@@ scored earlier this month when the Navy reported that three crew members who served on the USS George H.@@ W. Bush took their own lives within a week .
Asked about the deaths in the crew of the aircraft carrier , Defense Secretary Mark Esper said , " I wish I could tell you we have an answer to prevent further , future su@@ icides in the Armed Services . We don 't . We are caught up in what some call a national epidemic of suicide among our youth . "
The number of su@@ icides across the military increased from 5@@ 11 in 2017 to 5@@ 41 in 2018 . According to the Pentagon , the most at-@@ risk population is young en@@ listed men , and at least 60 percent of the time they chose a gun as their suicide method . Army su@@ icides went from 1@@ 14 to 13@@ 9 , while the Mar@@ ines went from 43 to 58 and the Navy went from 65 to 68 . The Air Force di@@ pped from 63 to 60 .
" Our numbers are not moving in the right direction , " said Elizabeth Van Win@@ kle , director of the Pentagon 's office of force resili@@ ency . She said that most of the military rates are compar@@ able to civilians , but added , " that 's hardly com@@ for@@ ting . "
Military and defense leaders expressed dis@@ may and a resolve to do more to increase resilience in the force , train service members how to handle stress better and encourage troops to seek help when they need it . Van Win@@ kle said the military is also looking at increasing efforts to train troops on the safe storage of fire@@ arms and medication . She said there are no consistent rules or regulations across the department and the services requiring gun locks or other controls on fire@@ arms , but that some states or bases have their own restrictions .
She and Karen Or@@ vis , director of the suicide prevention office , said recogn@@ izing service members who may be struggling or at risk of taking their own lives is very difficult , and that sometimes suicide is a sudden , impul@@ sive decision with little warning . They said it 's difficult to identify reasons for suicide because there are so many st@@ resses that could contribute .
They also acknowledged that service members are reluctant to come forward and seek help , because they worry that it could affect promo@@ tions or security clear@@ ances . And military leaders said they must all work harder to address those perceived road@@ blocks .
" Just as we talk about physical fitness , mark@@ s@@ man@@ ship , training and education , Mar@@ ines must also be comfortable discussing life 's struggles , mental well@@ ness and suicide , " said Gen. David Ber@@ ger , comm@@ and@@ ant of the Marine Corps . " We must create a community where seeking help and assistance are simply normal , important decisions Mar@@ ines and sail@@ ors make . "
This year for the first time , the Pentagon included statistics for su@@ icides by military sp@@ ous@@ es and depen@@ dents . Van Win@@ kle said the most recent numbers available were for 2017 , but officials are working to get better at collecting family data .
According to the report , there were 18@@ 6 families that had su@@ icides - 12@@ 3 were sp@@ ous@@ es and 63 were depen@@ dents between the ages of 12 and 23 .
The vast majority - nearly 70 percent - were female sp@@ ous@@ es under the age of 40 , while 70 percent of the dependent su@@ icides were m@@ ales . About half of the depen@@ dents who died by suicide were at least 18 years old and , for those younger than that , most of the deaths were youth between 15 and 17 .

Man gets prison after woman finds bullet in her sk@@ ull
A Georgia man has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for shooting his girlfriend , who didn 't realize she survived a bullet to the brain until she went to the hospital for treatment of head@@ aches .
News outlets report 39@@ -year-old Jer@@ ron@@ ta@@ e Cain was sentenced Thursday on charges including being a fel@@ on in possession of a gun in the 2017 attack on 4@@ 2-year-old Nicole Gordon .

Sony , Disney Back To Work On Third Spider-@@ Man Film
Loo@@ ks like there will be a home@@ coming of sorts for Spider-@@ Man , now that Disney and Sony have settled their differences .
The two studios announced on Friday that they will collabor@@ ate on a third Spider-@@ Man film starring Tom Holland .
The as yet un@@ titled film will be released on July 16 , 2021 , and be produced by the Disne@@ y-@@ owned Marvel Studios and its president , Kevin Fei@@ ge , according to a press release sent by both studios .
Amy Pas@@ cal will also produce through Pas@@ cal Pictures , as she has on the first two Holl@@ and-@@ led films , the release said .
" I am thrilled that Sp@@ ide@@ y 's journey in the MC@@ U will continue , and I and all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working on it , " Fei@@ ge said in the release . " Spider-@@ Man is a powerful icon and hero whose story cros@@ ses all ages and audiences around the globe . "
The agreement also allows Sp@@ ide@@ y to appear in a future Marvel Studios film .
Fei@@ ge acknowledged the collaboration makes the web@@ sl@@ inger unique among super@@ heroes .
" [ Spider-@@ Man ] happens to be the only hero with the super@@ power to cross cinem@@ atic univers@@ es , so as Sony continues to develop their own Sp@@ ide@@ y-@@ verse you never know what surpris@@ es the future might hold , " he said .
The end to the Sp@@ ide@@ y stand@@ off came more than a month after it was reported the two studios were unable to reach terms on a deal for a sequel to their previous films , " Home@@ coming " and " Far From Home . "
The sticking point was that Disney ― which owns the character ― reportedly wanted a co-@@ financing stake in future films with Sony , which has the film rights thanks to deals set up before the M@@ ouse bought Marvel in 2009 .
The Hollywood Reporter notes both sides had good reason to come together . " Far From Home " is Sony 's biggest box office hit ever , while Marvel gets to maxim@@ ize merch@@ and@@ ising and keep creative control .
One person who was happy the imp@@ asse has ended was Holland himself , who expressed his joy on Instagram .
EU , British negoti@@ ators work toward Brexit deal in Belgium
The European Union 's chief Brexit negoti@@ ator began talks With British officials in Belgium Friday to work toward an agreement , with about a month remaining before the departure deadline .
Michel Barnier met with Brexit secretary Stephen Barcl@@ ay in Brussels , who was ad@@ am@@ ant the Irish " backstop " be stripped from any deal . The backstop , effectively an assur@@ ance of a soft border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Britain leaves , has been perhaps the chief obst@@ acle in negotiations .
While Barcl@@ ay said Britain is committed to finding a deal , he said there isn 't much time left .
" I think there is still a long way to go . I think we are coming to the moment of truth in these negotiations , " he said .
The deadline to leave the EU is Oct. 31 , but a new British law prev@@ ents Prime Minister Boris Johnson from completing the withdrawal without a trade agreement , or Parliament 's approval to leave without one by Oct. 19 .
Last week , EU negoti@@ ators said they are open to an alternative to the backstop -- but Irish deputy Simon Co@@ ven@@ ey said Friday London hasn 't yet submitted a " serious " proposal .
" Until there is a serious proposal , which can be the basis of negotiations , then the gaps which are wide at the moment will remain , " he said .
He added that " time is running out " and " the on@@ us is on the British prime minister and his team " to put serious proposals on the table .
Johnson 's office said Friday there are still " significant obst@@ acles " to a deal .
" From an Irish perspective , we of course think that an extension is pre@@ fer@@ able to a no-deal , " Co@@ ven@@ ey said . " But I think there would have to be good reason behind that to ask for an extension . "
EU President Jean-@@ Claude Jun@@ cker said he and Barnier are doing everything they can for a deal and if they fail , it 's Britain 's fault .
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he 's not optimistic about a deal , but urged British leaders to present a plan at a Brexit summit on Oct. 17 .
" The withdrawal agreement is actually an international treaty , " he said . " It 's not the kind of thing that can be am@@ ended or co@@ b@@ bled together late at night . "
Scientists pu@@ zz@@ led by really big planet or@@ b@@ iting really little star
Scientists are expressing surprise after dis@@ covering a solar system 30 ligh@@ t-@@ years away from Earth that de@@ fies current understanding about planet formation , with a large Jup@@ it@@ er-@@ like planet or@@ b@@ iting a dimin@@ u@@ tive star known as a red d@@ warf .
An artistic impression of the gas giant planet G@@ J 35@@ 12@@ b or@@ b@@ iting its red d@@ warf host star , released on September 26 , 2019 .
Stars generally are much bigger than even the largest plan@@ ets that orbit them . But in this case , the star and the planet are not much different in size , the researchers said on Thursday .
The star , called G@@ J 35@@ 12 , is about 12 % the size of our sun , while the planet that or@@ bits it has a mass of at least about half of Jup@@ iter , our solar system 's largest planet .
" Yes , an absolute surprise , " said astro@@ physi@@ c@@ ist Juan Carlos Morales of the Institute of Space Studies of Catal@@ onia at the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain , who led the research published in the journal Science .
" The discovery was surprising because theo@@ reti@@ cal formation models suggest that low-@@ mass stars typically host small plan@@ ets , similar to Earth or small Ne@@ p@@ tun@@ es . In this case , we have found a gas giant planet similar to Jup@@ iter around a very small star , " Morales added .
The planet , which like Jup@@ iter is com@@ posed mainly of gas , was discovered using a tel@@ es@@ cope at the Cal@@ ar Al@@ to Observ@@ atory in Spain . It travel@@ s around its star in a very el@@ lip@@ tical orbit lasting 20@@ 4 days .
Red d@@ war@@ fs are small , with relatively low surface temperatures . G@@ J 35@@ 12 is not only much smaller than our sun , it is somewhat compar@@ able in size to a very large planet , being only about 35 % bigger than Jup@@ iter .
" They em@@ it less energy , so they are f@@ ain@@ ter than the sun , and their surface temperature is rather cool , below 3@@ 800 ( degrees ) Kel@@ vin ( 6,@@ 3@@ 80 degrees Fahr@@ enheit / 3,@@ 5@@ 27 Celsius ) approximately . This is why the have a red@@ dish color , " Morales said .
There is evidence of a second planet currently or@@ b@@ iting the star , while a third planet might have been e@@ jected from the star system in the past , explaining the el@@ lip@@ tical orbit of the Jup@@ it@@ er-@@ like planet , Morales said .
Plan@@ ets are born from the same dis@@ k of inter@@ stell@@ ar gas and dust that produces the star around which they orbit . Under the leading model for plan@@ etary formation , called the " core ac@@ cre@@ tion " model , an object initially forms from solid particles in the dis@@ k and the gra@@ vit@@ ational tu@@ g of this embr@@ y@@ onic planet allows for an atmosphere to ar@@ ise from the surrounding gas .
A competing model , called the gra@@ vit@@ ational inst@@ ability model , may explain this unusual system .
" In this case , the pro@@ top@@ lan@@ etary dis@@ k around the young star may be slightly more massive than expected and cold , " Morales said . " This makes the dis@@ k become un@@ stable so some den@@ se regions can appear . These cl@@ um@@ ps can grow until they collapse , forming a planet . "
School stri@@ kers around the world march to demand action on climate
Children around the world launched another wave of school strikes demanding action on climate change Friday , in their first major action since the issue topped world leader 's agenda at the United Nations this week .
The Fri@@ days for Future movement that began as a l@@ one demonstration by Swedish teen Greta Thun@@ berg@@ just over a year ago has mus@@ h@@ ro@@ omed , with millions of students taking to the streets of cities like New Yor@@ k@@ and attr@@ acting attention in developing nations across Africa .
Some of the first protests began in New Zealand , where Thunberg sa@@ id@@ organizers estimated 17@@ 0,000 people mar@@ ched across the country . There were also mar@@ ches in cities in Italy , Fin@@ land , Nigeria , Austria and India , among other countries .
Friday 's protest followed a week of climate talks at the United Nations in New York , which included a sc@@ a@@ thing speech by Thun@@ berg@@ to world leaders re@@ pri@@ mand@@ ing them for in@@ action .
" You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words , " she said on Tuesday . " The eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us , I say we will never for@@ give you . "
C@@ iting a U.@@ N.@@ -@@ backed repor@@ tre@@ le@@ ased last year , demonstrators are demanding governments implement measures to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2.@@ 7 degrees , which scientists warn result in dire consequences for human life and the planet .
Thunberg and the young people she has inspired say they will not stop their weekly classroom wal@@ k@@ outs until they see a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change .
In Nigeria 's capital Abuja , O@@ lad@@ os@@ u A@@ den@@ i@@ ke marked her 46@@ th consecutive strike on Friday . The activist posted images on Twitter of students dressed in blue school uni@@ forms carrying bann@@ ers with messages , " Climate change is real " and " We don 't have time . "
In L@@ aus@@ anne , Switzerland , where hundreds of climate strike organizers gather@@ ed@@ in August planning for this week 's events , thousands of people mar@@ ched through the city , according to local reports .
Thousands more were expected to take to the streets of Hel@@ sin@@ ki , Fin@@ land , where local media repor@@ te@@ d@@ that the city 's school would allow students to participate .
Thunberg , who remains in North America following her visit to the U.N. , was scheduled to participate in climate strikes in Montreal , Canada .
Serena Williams Fin@@ ed $ 10,000 For Alle@@ gedly Dam@@ aging Wimbledon Court
Serena Williams , tennis legend and seven-@@ time Wimbledon champion , is being fined $ 10,000 for allegedly damaging the London practice courts with her rac@@ quet .
The All England Club , which hosts the Wimbledon tournament , handed the fine to Williams after she reportedly caused damage during a practice round on the outside courts on June 30 , according to The Associated Press and CNN .
The 37@@ -year-old tennis star appeared to shr@@ u@@ g off the fine while speaking to reporters after winning the quarter@@ final round against Alison Ris@@ ke on Tuesday .
" I haven 't really thought about it , to be honest , " she said when asked about the fine . " I just threw my rac@@ quet . I got fined . "
Williams said she didn 't know how that could 've caused damage .
" I mean , I guess if you could tell me , I would appreciate it , " she told reporters . " I mean , I have always been an Aven@@ ger in my heart . Maybe I 'm super strong . I don 't know . "
Williams is after her eighth Wimbledon title , which would be her 24@@ th grand sl@@ am victory . She is adv@@ ancing to the singles semi@@ finals on Thursday against Czech player Bar@@ bor@@ a Str@@ ý@@ co@@ v@@ á .
Williams was also fined a total of $ 17@@ ,000 last year after she defended herself against an ump@@ ire at the U.S. Open who accused her of illegally communic@@ ating with her coach during a match .
During that incident , the ump@@ ire issued three code violations to Williams : One for receiving illegal coaching , a second for breaking her tennis r@@ ack@@ et in frustration and a third after she confronted the ump@@ ire and called him a " th@@ ief . "
Many of Williams " fans claimed that the ump@@ ire was un@@ necessarily harsh in his response to her , especially considering male players " mel@@ t@@ downs throughout the history of the sport .
" Do you know how many other men do things that are much worse than that ? " Williams told U.S. Open officials who entered the court during the match after her confrontation with the ump@@ ire .
Williams wasn 't the only one who received a fine at this year 's Wimbledon , though h@@ ers was the most costly .
Italian player Fab@@ io Fo@@ gn@@ ini was fined $ 3,000 for saying a " bomb should explo@@ de " at the tennis courts after he lost the third round to U.S. player Tenn@@ ys Sand@@ gr@@ en on Saturday .
Nick Kyrgios of Australia was hit with two fines ― one for $ 3,000 and a second for $ 5,000 ― for un@@ spor@@ ts@@ man@@ like conduct .
The Who S@@ TO@@ P concert last night : Friday and Sunday shows C@@ AN@@ CE@@ L@@ LED
Rock legen@@ ds The Who are on a major US tour . In Houston , Texas , Roger Dal@@ tre@@ y was forced to call off the concert less than half@@ way through . The 75@@ -year-old told the disappointed audience : " I think I should quit while I 'm ahead . " The band had performed eight songs already but promised to try and return for another show one day in the future . Watch the video of how it all unfol@@ ded on stage .
After playing classic 1982 track E@@ min@@ ence Front , Dal@@ tre@@ y called it qu@@ it@@ s. he has struggled with vocal issues and apparently is under strict instructions from his sur@@ geon .
The British star told the crowd he couldn 't go on with the show : " If I carry on trying to do what I 'm doing for you , I 'm going to damage myself . I think I should quit while I 'm ahead ... Last time , I ended up in hospital for a month and I 'm not going there again . Sor@@ ry . "
Pete Town@@ sh@@ end explained what was going on to the audience : " It sounds like he cannot do any more , I 'm afraid ... "
The band left the stage , originally suggesting they would try to work out the rest of the set without Roger .
When he returned , Townsend said : " I 'm really , really sorry . Roger cannot actually speak now .
" Ap@@ par@@ ently , before the show , he saw a doctor , and you know , he 's been singing so f * * * ing great through this tour . I don 't know what the f * * * is going on . He has been on top of his game .
" I 'm really sorry this has happened to you guys tonight ... I don 't think there is much point trying to put anything together that makes any sense because this is Roger 's show and he 's not in good shape . "
The crowd was completely supportive , che@@ ering the 7@@ 4@@ -year-old as he explained what had happened and how the band hoped to return to honour their commitment to the show .
Townsend said ; " We will publish a date for our return as soon as we can . Let me explain one thing ... We only do one day on , one day off . This is because Roger 's vocal sur@@ geon insists he has a day off ...
" I swe@@ ar to you we will come back and we will honour your tickets . I love you so much and I 'm sorry to let you down . "
Following the show , the upcoming Friday and Sunday night concer@@ ts in Dallas and Denver were cancelled .
Their next show is on October 9 in San Francisco . The band will open their UK tour in Manchester n March 16 , 2020 .

Meghan Markle is determined to ' ful@@ fil her heart 's des@@ ires ' and not let her own needs ' fa@@ de away ' now she 's a member of the Royal Family - and wants to be a role model for young boys as well as girls .
The Duchess of Sussex , 38 , reportedly made the remarks during an event for inspiring female entreprene@@ urs at Wood@@ stock Exchange in Cape Town earlier this week during her tour of South Africa with husband Prince Harry .
Wood@@ stock Exchange , the UK@@ -S@@ A Tech Hub , focuses on skills development and access to markets by assi@@ sting entreprene@@ urs , particularly women , to acqu@@ ire skills , resources and support .
The La@@ dies Who La@@ unch meeting saw the former actress , 38 , meet with several women who have set up their own businesses in industries such as technology , conservation and fashion and praise them for ' empower@@ ing the next generation ' of creative minds .
During a conversation with the female tech fo@@ unders Meghan , who has campaig@@ ned vig@@ or@@ ously for the empower@@ ment of young women and girls , said she hopes to do the same for young men .
Mother@@ -of-@@ two Na@@ adi@@ ya Moo@@ sa@@ jee , a South African engineer , social entreprene@@ ur and co-founder of Women in Engineering , revealed : ' We acknowledged the importance of not just education for girls but being role models for boys - that we are women who are influential and who boys can look up to as well , ' People reports .
'We both have sons , and we were bearing in mind that we are not just role models for girls but boys - and not just our sons , but generally in public too . ' 
She added that having Meghan present ' didn 't feel hier@@ arch@@ ical ' , as it was ' women gathered together and a talk about the struggles we have , as well as the things we need to do to move forward and grow and change our soc@@ ieties ' .
M@@ ats@@ i Mod@@ ise , founder of skills training company Sim@@ o@@ dis@@ a , said Meghan is determined to continue to champion the issues close to her heart despite being a member of the F@@ old .
'@@ She talked about being a mother and having duties as a du@@ chess and ful@@ filling what her heart des@@ ires - and that it can 't just fa@@ de away now that you 're a du@@ chess , ' Mod@@ ise recalled .
'@@ That you have to be true to who you are . ' 
She said the du@@ chess pushed them to pl@@ ough ahead with their new ideas and spoke about how they have to keep pushing and going forward , knowing they are doing it for others who will follow .
'@@ She wasn 't referring to being a royal , but life in general when you have challenges , ' Mod@@ ise added , admitting she felt a bit ' a@@ we@@ struck ' by Meghan .
'@@ She radi@@ ates gr@@ ace and she is taking this task that she has with such gr@@ ace , ' Mod@@ ise said .
'@@ A lot of us have done amazing things as fo@@ unders , but meeting a royal is quite da@@ unting . She made it easy . She is an eas@@ y-@@ going royal . ' 
Meghan also revealed she 's enjoying the pressures of being a working mother , admitting she finds ju@@ g@@ gling being a royal and looking after baby Archie ' a lot ' but ' all so exciting ' .
Speaking to mother@@ -of-@@ two L@@ ara Ros@@ mar@@ in , CEO of Cape Innovation and Technology , Meghan said : ' We 're only five months in right now . Being a working mum and travelling as well with a baby , my goo@@ dness it 's a lot , but it 's all so exciting .
'@@ There are days when it 's a lot to ju@@ g@@ gle but then you meet someone and you have an impact on them and you say " ah@@ -@@ ha , " and it 's so rewar@@ ding . ' 
Meghan then went to the city 's Mother@@ s@@ 2@@ Mo@@ thers organisation , which trains and emplo@@ ys women with HIV .
She took along some of Archie 's baby clothes , including a on@@ es@@ ie saying ' The Future ' and his In@@ vic@@ tus bab@@ y@@ gr@@ o which he no longer fits , alongside donations from her friends with children .
Parents of 5-@@ month-@@ old stu@@ ffed in su@@ it@@ case and tos@@ sed in d@@ ump@@ ster get 6 years in prison
The parents of a 5 ½ -@@ month-@@ old boy whose body was thrown in a d@@ ump@@ ster were sentenced to six years in prison after ple@@ ading no contest Thursday to charges in the baby 's death .
Adam Man@@ son , 34 , and K@@ iana Williams , 32 , each pleaded no contest to one fel@@ ony count of child abuse resulting in death and admitted to a special allegation that they caused the death of their son , Jac@@ sun Man@@ son , the Los Angeles County district attorney announced .
Man@@ son and Williams had initially pleaded not guilty to the charges .
The two had been doing drugs in a South L.A. mo@@ tel on New Year 's Eve when they found the baby dead , prosecutors said . They placed his body in a su@@ it@@ case and tos@@ sed it in a trash bin near the Baldwin Hills C@@ ren@@ shaw Plaza , prosecutors said .
In late April , weeks after searching through the El Sob@@ ran@@ te Land@@ fill in Cor@@ ona , authorities called off the search . The child 's body was never found .
Police said in a statement at the time that they made the decision to end the search for Jac@@ sun with a " heavy heart , " but noted they couldn 't pin@@ point a location in the land@@ fill " to a point that would make continuing the search reasonable . "
UK 's medical drug supply still uncertain in no-deal Brexit
Britain 's government watchdog says there is still a " significant amount " of work to do to ensure the country has an adequate supply of medical drugs in case of a no-deal Brexit .
In a report issued Friday , Britain 's National Au@@ dit Office said additional shipping capacity char@@ tered by the U.K. for sending goods across the English Channel might not be operational until the end of November - one month after the Oct. 31 deadline for Britain to leave the European Union . Of the more than 12,@@ 300 medicines licensed in the U.K. , about 7,000 arrive from or via the EU , mostly across the Channel .
According to the British government 's " reasonable wor@@ st-@@ case " scenario , the flow of goods could be cut by half on Day One of a no-deal Brexit and could take a year to recover . It said time was " extremely limited " if the shipping issues were to be resolved by the end of October .
The report also said there was " in@@ complete information " about the levels of medicine stock@@ pil@@ ing but that levels were increasingly daily . As of Sept . 20 , suppliers reported that 72 % of medicines had a six-@@ week stock@@ pile .
" In the event of a no-deal exit , the department ( of health ) would be working in a highly uncertain environment and operating all the elements of its plan would be a hugely demanding task , " the watchdog wrote .
Me@@ g H@@ illi@@ er , who chairs a committee over@@ seeing the audit office , called the findings " deeply concerning . " She said she had seen " countless examples " of the British government missing dead@@ lines , but that this one was particularly striking .
" If the government gets this wrong , it could have the gra@@ vest of consequences , " she said .
Dr. Richard Tor@@ bett of the Association of the British Pharmac@@ eutical Industry said that while companies have been working to prepare for Brexit , " some things are outside of their control . "
He said more details were needed on how companies might access government-@@ planned fre@@ ight capacity if Britain sees a no-deal departure from the EU .
" Secur@@ ing a ( Brexit ) deal remains the best way to protect patients , " he said .
Cleveland police branded ' failing ' in all areas by inspec@@ tors
Sc@@ and@@ al-@@ hit Cleveland police has become the first force to be branded " failing " in all areas by inspec@@ tors .
It has been rated in@@ adequate overall and in three key areas by Her Majest@@ y 's Inspec@@ torate of Con@@ stab@@ ul@@ ary and Fire and Rescue Services ( HM@@ IC@@ FR@@ S ) , which scru@@ tin@@ ised its ability to reduce crime and keep people safe , operate effici@@ ently , as well as the way it treats the public and its workforce .
The findings mean the force is effectively plunged into special measures , where the chief const@@ able and police and crime commissioner are called before a national board and questioned about their plans to ensure " critical improvements " are made .
The home secretary could then step in to tackle the problem if no progress is made .
A string of sc@@ andals has pl@@ agu@@ ed the force , covering Hart@@ le@@ pool , Red@@ car and Cleveland , Stock@@ ton and Midd@@ lesb@@ rough in the north east of England .
It has seen six chief const@@ ables in almost as many years .
Former chief const@@ able Sean Price was sacked for gross misconduct in 2012 ; seven officers were under investigation after journalists " phones were un@@ law@@ fully monit@@ ored , and there have been long-@@ standing claims of racism within the ranks .
Work practices were recently described by the chief inspector of const@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary as being about as " in@@ efficient as you can possibly imagine , " with officers having to share lap@@ tops and bo@@ dy@@ worn cameras .
H@@ M Inspector of Con@@ stab@@ ul@@ ary Phil Gor@@ m@@ ley said it was a " failing force " where there had been " significant " deterior@@ ation in the last two years .
Te@@ es Valley mayor Ben Hou@@ chen said the report described the " worst findings ever into any police force in the country " which was " finally the official vali@@ dation " that the force is " broken " and said the Home Office needed to intervene now .
He added : " It 's no longer in dispute . It is a fact described in black and white in this report .
" The findings are some of the most dist@@ ressing and shocking I have ever read . "
Cleveland is one of 15 forces that has been recently insp@@ ected by HM@@ IC@@ FR@@ S inspec@@ tors , and the only one rated in@@ adequate in all areas .
Gor@@ m@@ ley added : " The force doesn 't appropri@@ ately priorit@@ ise crime prevention . There is a lack of strategic direction , and the force doesn 't al@@ locate enough resources to prevention work ... It is failing to respond appropri@@ ately to vulnerable people , including children . It is missing opportunities to safe@@ guard them and expos@@ ing them to risk . "
He said senior leaders were not consistently demonstr@@ ating " ethical behaviour , " and the " inappropriate behaviour of senior leaders within Cleveland is so profound that it is affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the force . "
He added : " It doesn 't consistently treat its workforce with fair@@ ness and respect and it doesn 't effectively communicate with or engage its workforce ; its processes aren 't perceived to be fair and it doesn 't understand its workforce well enough to support them . "
Despite the findings , the force did receive a small amount of praise for the way it tackles serious and organised crime but was told it must improve the way it investig@@ ates crimes .
The force 's police and crime commissioner Barry C@@ opp@@ inger said : " I am deeply concerned at the worrying cont@@ ents of this report .
" The force 's recent performance is simply not good enough . "
He said he had received assur@@ ances from the current chief const@@ able Richard Lewis that " swift action " was taken as soon as he became aware of the fail@@ ings .
C@@ opp@@ inger has been ordered by the Home Office to respond to the report within 56 days .
Lewis said the report would act " as a line in the sand " for the force , adding : " Im@@ prov@@ ements have already been made and I take full responsibility for driving through the changes that are so obviously needed . In the five months I 've been here I have met some exceptional police officers and staff , at all levels , and have seen lives saved and vulnerable people protected by the efforts and determination of frontline officers . "
If dra@@ stic improvements are not made quickly enough , the Government could step in , as it can when prisons are failing .
But so far politicians have never had to resort to this measure with police forces , inspec@@ tors said .
Kit Mal@@ thouse , minister for crime , policing and fire , said he welcomed the chief const@@ able 's " swift action to address these fail@@ ings and will be monitoring the position closely , " adding : " Transpar@@ ency and accountability are vital for public trust in policing .
Im@@ manuel Christian School : Six@@ th-@@ grade boys accused of p@@ inning down black girl and cutting off her dre@@ ad@@ locks in Virginia
A black middle school student from Virginia is accusing three white boys of p@@ inning her down and cutting off her dre@@ ad@@ locks . The incident took place at Im@@ manuel Christian School - where Vice President Mike Pence 's wife , Karen Pence , is a teacher .
Amar@@ i Allen , a 12@@ -year-old student at the private K-@@ 12 Christian school , said the boys called her dre@@ ad@@ locks " ugly " and " n@@ app@@ y " before cutting them off on the play@@ ground during rec@@ ess .
" They kept laughing and calling me names , " Amar@@ i told CBS affili@@ ate W@@ US@@ A-@@ TV , te@@ aring up . " They called me ' ugly , ' said , ' I shouldn 't have been born . ' They called me ' an atten@@ tion-@@ see@@ ker . ' "
According to W@@ USA , one of the boys allegedly covered Amar@@ i 's mouth while another held her hands behind her back and a third took a pair of sc@@ iss@@ ors to her dre@@ ad@@ locks .
Amar@@ i didn 't tell her family about the incident until after her grandmother noticed the length of her hair had changed .
" They ran off laughing , and I was just sitting there , " Amar@@ i said .
The alleged incident occurred on Monday , but the shy pre@@ teen said she didn 't tell her family about it until Wednesday , after her grandmother noticed her hair looked different . She feared retali@@ ation if she conf@@ essed the truth , she said .
" It 's very painful , " said Cyn@@ thia Allen , Amar@@ i 's grandmother . " I want to see them dismissed from the school . I want to see something done . "
Allen 's family pays nearly $ 12@@ ,000 per year for Amar@@ i to attend the school , which made headlines earlier this year after Karen Pence took an art teaching job at the famously anti-@@ LGBTQ institution .
" We take seriously the emotional and physical well-being of all our students , and have a zer@@ o-@@ tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse , " Im@@ manuel Christian School said in a statement . " We are deeply distur@@ bed by the allegations being made , and are in communication with the family of the alleged victim to gather information and provide whatever support we can . We have also reached out to law enforcement to ask them to conduct a thor@@ ough investigation , and further in@@ quiries should be directed to the Fair@@ fax County Police . "
While the school has a zer@@ o-@@ tolerance policy for bullying , Amar@@ i said the boys had previously tor@@ mented her . She said that the boys have taken her lunch and called her names in the past .
Amar@@ i 's family met with school officials Thursday , and the investigation is ongoing .
Iran releases British oil tanker St@@ ena Im@@ per@@ o
Iran released a Brit@@ ish-@@ flag@@ ged oil tanker on Friday , two months after it captured the vessel for allegedly entering its waters in violation of international law .
Iranian P@@ orts and Mar@@ itime Administration confirmed that the vessel , St@@ ena Im@@ per@@ o , left Band@@ ar Ab@@ bas port at 9 a.m. , the state-@@ run IR@@ NA reported .
Erik Han@@ ell , president and CEO of St@@ ena Bul@@ k , the operator of the ship , also confirmed the ship 's release .
" St@@ ena Bul@@ k and Northern Marine Management confirm the St@@ ena Im@@ per@@ o and its crew have been released , " he said via Twitter .
The ship was captured by the Iranian Revolution@@ ary Guard Corps on July 19 for having violated international mar@@ itime law when it allegedly ve@@ ered into Iranian waters in the Stra@@ it of Hor@@ mu@@ z .
The vessel 's sei@@ z@@ ure , however , was widely seen as retali@@ atory for British forces cap@@ turing a tanker off Gi@@ br@@ altar on suspicion of transpor@@ ting Per@@ sian oil to Syria in violation of international sanctions . The ship was released in mid-@@ August despite the Trump administration making a last-@@ ditch attempt to length its detention .
The St@@ ena Im@@ per@@ o was officially given permission to leave on Monday but was kept in port until a probe into the ship 's conduct completed , the New York Times reported .
" The vessel has left the port of Band@@ ar Ab@@ bas and is trans@@ iting to Dubai for the crew to dis@@ embar@@ k and receive medical checks and deb@@ rief@@ ing , " Han@@ ell said . " The families of crew members have been informed and the Company is currently making arrangements for the re@@ patri@@ ation of its valued seaf@@ ar@@ ers at the earliest possible opportunity . "
The ship became victim to escal@@ ating tensions near the Per@@ sian Gulf where both the United States and Iran shot down the other 's drone and at least two t@@ ank@@ ers were sab@@ ot@@ aged by explo@@ sives , which the Trump administration has blamed Iran for .
The Trump administration most recently blamed Iran for drone attacks on Saudi Arab@@ ian oil facilities , which Tehran denies having any involvement with .
PM Modi Tweets Tri@@ bu@@ te To Jac@@ ques Chir@@ ac , C@@ alls H@@ im True Global Stat@@ es@@ man , Fri@@ end Of India
Prime Minister Narendra Modi condol@@ ed the death of former French president Jac@@ ques Chir@@ ac , saying India mo@@ ur@@ ns the loss of a true global stat@@ es@@ man and friend .
Jac@@ ques Chir@@ ac , who supported India after it conducted nuclear tests in 1998 , died on Thursday at age 86 . He served as the president of France from 1995 to 2007 .
" My deep@@ est condol@@ ences on passing away of Jac@@ ques Chir@@ ac . India mo@@ ur@@ ns the loss of a true global stat@@ es@@ man . A friend of India , he played a decisive role in establishing and building Indi@@ a-@@ France Strate@@ gic Part@@ nership , " Prime Minister Modi tweeted .
India and France have a strategic partnership , initi@@ ated in January 1998 during Jac@@ ques Chir@@ ac 's first visit to India . He again visited the country as president in 2006 .
Jac@@ ques Chir@@ ac was known to have been suffering from ill health for a long time .
Uganda : Government Laun@@ ches Or@@ al HIV Sel@@ f-@@ Test Kit
Ministry of Health has launched an oral HIV self-@@ test kit aimed at empower@@ ing citizens , especially men to carry out HIV testing .
The initiative is aimed at reducing new HIV / A@@ ids infections by 2020 .
The oral HIV test kit dubbed , O@@ ra@@ Qu@@ ick HIV self-@@ test , a product of Or@@ as@@ ure technologies , targets young people aged 18 to 24 years , men and priority populations such as sex workers .
" Currently we are targeting young people 18 to 24 years . For the young people that 's the age br@@ ack@@ et we are looking at but of course any one above 18 and it 's because we do not have evidence of children by the Constitution but as more evidence unfol@@ ds we are going to get there . For the men , we give the kit to the mother and they take it to the partner , key and priority populations such sex workers , " Mr Ge@@ offrey Tas@@ i , the technical offic@@ er-@@ in-@@ charge of HIV testing services , said yesterday .
Eas@@ y use
Initi@@ ally , the self-@@ test kits available involve the use of blood to detect the HIV , however , with oral HIV self-@@ test kit , oral flu@@ ids are involved .
The test works by dete@@ cting antibodies , the body 's natural defenders against infection . If one is infected with HIV , these antibodies will be present in your blood and also in the s@@ ali@@ via . The test will detect the antibodies in the mouth .
Data by the Uganda A@@ ids Commission ( U@@ AC ) shows that Uganda is regist@@ ering 1,000 new HIV / A@@ ids infections and 500 deaths from the viral disease per week , transl@@ ating into 5@@ 3,000 new infections and 23@@ ,000 deaths annually .
Dr Diana A@@ tw@@ ine , the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health , said this is timely and will enhance the fight against HIV / A@@ ids .
She , however , urged the men to take HIV testing as an important issue .
She added that there is still effort to reach the 14 per cent of the people , who are living with HIV but do not know their HIV status .
" Currently , 86 per cent people living with HIV know their status ; that means it leave us with 14 per cent of those living with HIV and do not know their status . So how do we now util@@ ise that additional innovation . Re@@ ally for me this is it ... how do we now move from this kit and create demand , especially for that 14 per cent that are sick and they need care and they are not getting care , " Dr A@@ tw@@ ine said .
However , health officials warn one should not eat or drink within 15 minutes before starting the test .
Mr Tas@@ i said studies conducted showed no suicide cases and the ministry is confident that the potential of harm can be avoided because the test is voluntary .
Dr A@@ tw@@ ine said apart from graph@@ ics and videos provided to educ@@ ate the users , there should be toll free numbers always available to offer coun@@ selling in both government and private facilities , including all pharmac@@ ies .
Research . According to the research , O@@ ra@@ Qu@@ ick HIV self-@@ test detected more than 99 per cent of people , who were infected with HIV and people , who were not infected with HIV .
Athle@@ tes feeling the heat at Qatar world championships
Some competitors at the world athle@@ tics championships that began on Friday have already en@@ countered their most challenging opponent : the s@@ wel@@ tering Q@@ at@@ ari heat .
With its suff@@ oc@@ ating hum@@ idity and day@@ time temperatures ho@@ vering around 38 degrees Celsius , Doha weather has been widely discussed among athletes and athle@@ tics officials and seen as a cause for concern in some events .
Those competing on the road in the marathon and walking races will begin their events in the middle of the night to minim@@ ize the heat 's harmful effects .
Although the heat is less of a threat to the athletes competing inside the Khal@@ ifa International Stadium , where temperatures are kept at around 21 degrees with the help of a cool@@ ing system , they have still had to adjust their training because they prac@@ tise at an outdoor facility .
" We are from a hot climate as well , but nothing to compare with this , " Bah@@ am@@ ian coach Ronald Car@@ tw@@ right told Reuters .
" Here you walk outside and it 's like somebody put a he@@ ater on you . I guess that is why they are doing it at night . "
Athle@@ tics officials have pledged additional medical and safety measures for marathon runners and race wal@@ kers .
The IA@@ A@@ F , the global governing body of athle@@ tics , said the women 's marathon , scheduled to start at midnight on Friday , would go ahead as planned as temperatures would be at or below 30 degrees .
It said its medical deleg@@ ate had assured athletes that weather conditions would be monit@@ ored all day and reported to the teams " to ensure the event is run at an acceptable level of health risk . "
Track athletes competing inside the stadium said it was unlikely that the heat would significantly affect their performances , but conceded that practices have been especially dra@@ ining .
" At practice I 'm g@@ lowing because I 'm swe@@ ating because it 's so hum@@ id , " said Ra@@ i Benjamin , who compet@@ es in the 4@@ 00m hur@@ d@@ les .
" It 's like I got out of the shower . But I don 't think it will be that bad because of the cool@@ ing system . "
Sho@@ t p@@ utter Ryan Cro@@ user , the 2016 Olympic champion , said he has had to heat up his shots to around 38 degrees Celsius to prevent them from becoming wet during practices in the si@@ zz@@ ling heat and high hum@@ idity .
" The shot is far below the de@@ w point , the instant you take it out , it 's just so@@ aking wet and it 's dri@@ pping water , " the American said . " It 's worse than if it was pouring down rain ... We 've been fighting this a little bit . "
European pole v@@ ault champion Arm@@ and Du@@ pl@@ anti@@ s , who trains in the heat of the southern U.S. state of Louisiana , said the hum@@ idity can prove helpful in practice because the addition of moist@@ ure to the chal@@ k on his hands " makes for a really nice grip . "
But other pole v@@ aul@@ ters who spray a st@@ icky grip enh@@ ancer on their hands might have more difficulty holding onto their pol@@ es in the hum@@ idity , he said .
" For people who use st@@ icky spray , I can see it being a problem because it can get a little sli@@ my and goo@@ ey , " Du@@ pl@@ anti@@ s said .
Fe@@ ars of security breach at major prison as lock@@ s@@ mith is arrested
A prison lock@@ s@@ mith has been arrested amid fears keys to a jail 's cells have been cop@@ ied resulting in taxpayers foo@@ ting a £ 500,000 bill to replace all its locks .
H@@ MP Wand@@ sworth called in police amid fears that du@@ p@@ lic@@ ates had been sold to some of its 1,@@ 400 inmates .
The suspected security breach will result in 3,000 locks replaced , potentially to cell , internal and ou@@ ter doors .
Police arrested a 40@@ -year-old man at the jail on suspicion of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office on September 13 . The man , from South West London , was working for the Government Fac@@ ility Services Ltd , which main@@ tains 52 j@@ ails across the south of the country .
The police investigation has raised concerns that im@@ prints of some of the keys may have been taken in cl@@ ay before actual copies were produced .
However , prison bosses stressed that they had not found any evidence that inmates had obtained any keys .
Wand@@ sworth P@@ rison is a C@@ ateg@@ ory B jail in South West London which can house up to 1,@@ 6@@ 28 prisoners , making it one of the largest prisons in Western Europe . The jail , built in 18@@ 51 , holds convicted male criminals and those on rem@@ and awaiting trial .
A P@@ rison Service spokeswoman said : " H@@ MP Wand@@ sworth has increased security at the gate and is operating extra identity checks as a result of a security incident . It would be inappropriate to comment further while a police investigation is ongoing . "
House chair@@ men warn Trump to stop attacking whistleblower
" The President 's comments today const@@ itute re@@ preh@@ en@@ sible witness intimid@@ ation and an attempt to ob@@ struct Congress ' impeachment inquiry . We condem@@ n the President 's attacks , and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whistleblower , and all wh@@ istleb@@ lowers , " they said . " Thre@@ ats of violence from the leader of our country have a ch@@ illing effect on the entire whistleblower process , with grave consequences for our democracy and national security . "
The statement said Trump " is fully aware that our Commit@@ tees are seeking testimony from this whistleblower and others refer@@ enced in the whistleblower 's complaint released today as part of the House 's impeachment inquiry , and our nation 's laws prohib@@ it efforts to dis@@ courage , intimid@@ ate , or otherwise pressure a witness not to provide testimony to Congress . "
" No officials with knowledge relevant to the committees ' investigation , including knowledge of the subject of the whistleblower complaint , may be subject to any intimid@@ ation , re@@ pris@@ al , or threat of re@@ pris@@ al , and all witnesses must be made available for congressional testimony , " they added .
The statement on Thursday comes am@@ id@@ st an explosive week in Washington roo@@ ted in a whistleblower complaint alleg@@ ing that Trump abused his official powers " to solic@@ it interference " from Ukrainian President Vol@@ o@@ dymyr Zelensky in the upcoming 2020 election , and the White House took steps to cover it up . A tran@@ script of July phone conversation released by the White House on Wednesday shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son , Hunter .
There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden .
Even before the whistleblower complaint was made available to lawmakers , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday declared Trump had betra@@ yed his o@@ ath of office and announced she was opening a formal impeachment inquiry into the President .
Michelle Obama C@@ alls Meghan Markle ' An Inspiration ' In Ad@@ oring Instagram
Michelle Obama gave high praise to Meghan Markle in a sweet Instagram on Thursday , calling the Duchess of Sussex " a though@@ tful leader who is breaking the m@@ old and making our world better for it . "
The du@@ chess and Prince Harry , now on a 10-@@ day royal tour of South Africa with their baby son Archie Harrison Moun@@ t@@ b@@ atten@@ -@@ Windsor , attended a youth reception earlier this week and met Obama Foundation leaders .
" Thank you to my friend , Her Royal High@@ ness The Duchess of Sussex @ sus@@ sex@@ royal , a though@@ tful leader who is breaking the m@@ old and making our world better for it , " the former first lady wrote in her g@@ lowing post .
" Whether meeting with our @ Obam@@ a@@ Foundation Lea@@ ders or helping girls around the world seek the education they deserve , she is an inspiration to so many , " Obama added , alongside a photo of a smiling Meghan posing with foundation leaders .
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vogue , which the former " Su@@ its " actress gu@@ est@@ -@@ ed@@ ited . In their can@@ did chat , the former first lady reflected on mother@@ hood and how it 's changed her .
" Being a mother has been a master@@ class in letting go , " Obama said in the interview .
" Mother@@ hood has taught me that , most of the time , my job is to give them the space to explore and develop into the people they want to be . Not who I want them to be or who I wish I was at that age , but who they are , deep inside . "
Obama , who knows first-@@ hand the pressure of being under a global spotlight , dol@@ ed out some advice to the du@@ chess in an interview with Good House@@ keeping .
" The pressure you feel ― from yourself and from others ― can sometimes feel like a lot , " she said . " So my biggest piece of advice would be to take some time and don 't be in a hur@@ ry to do anything . "
She continued :
I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughters , making sure they were off to a good start at school and making new friends before I launched into any more ambitious work . I think it 's okay - it 's good , even - to do that .
Moment hero police officer rush@@ es onto busy motor@@ way to save dog hit by car
This is the hero@@ ic moment a police officer ran out onto a busy motor@@ way to rescue an injured dog .
Foot@@ age from Joseph Pu@@ gli@@ a 's dash@@ c@@ am shows him jumping out of his police car within seconds of seeing the dog get hit by another vehicle .
The officer , who works in Pin@@ ell@@ as Park , Florida , wrapped the wounded p@@ up in an emergency blanket , placed him in his SUV rushed to the ne@@ arest animal hospital .
" My heart really sank until I started seeing him breathing , " Mr Pu@@ gli@@ a told ABC news .
Thank@@ fully , the dog survived with just minor cuts and bru@@ ises .
" We nick@@ named him " Lu@@ cky " and I think the name applies , " the officer said . " He 's definitely one lucky dog . "
The dog was brought to a local animal shelter and his rescu@@ er has since been hailed as a hero .
But Mr Pu@@ gli@@ a insists he was just doing his job .
The officer added that if animal services cannot find the owner , some of his family members would be more than willing to give Lu@@ cky a home .
After WeWork deb@@ acle , IPO market sl@@ ams bra@@ kes on un@@ profitable companies
BO@@ S@@ TON ( Reuters ) - Companies making their debut on the U.S. stock market are getting a rough welcome , especially if they are losing money , casting a shadow over the calendar for initial public offer@@ ings for the rest of the year .
The surprise postpon@@ ement of the WeWork IPO has under@@ scored how confidence is ero@@ ding in the market both for companies looking to raise capital and investors .
A more disc@@ ern@@ ing market for initial public offer@@ ings continued to pun@@ ish Pel@@ ot@@ on Inter@@ active Inc P@@ TO@@ N.@@ O on Friday , a day after it began trading , as shares of the fitness start@@ up fell 4 % to $ 24.@@ 74 . The company is now trading 15 % below its Wednesday IPO price .
In the past , public market investors have typically expected companies to become profitable within 18 months or so of an IPO . This timeline has been relaxed with money managers eager to add businesses with fast-@@ growing revenue to their port@@ foli@@ os .
Re@@ cent deals , however , suggest an uncertain economic outlook is pushing investors to be more sel@@ ec@@ tive about the los@@ s-@@ making companies they are willing to back .
Pel@@ ot@@ on reported rapid top-@@ line growth of 110 % during the fiscal year that ended June 30 . But the company also showed negative operating leverage , with operating expenses sur@@ ging 14@@ 7 % over the prior year .
Lo@@ s@@ s-@@ making te@@ eth@@ -@@ al@@ ign@@ ment company S@@ mil@@ e@@ Direc@@ t@@ Club SD@@ C.@@ O earlier this month became the first U.S. IPO in three years to price above its target range and close down on its first trading day , according to research firm Ren@@ aissance Capital .
The average IPO return in 2019 is now about 9 % , down from more than 30 % at the end of June and more than 18 % about two weeks ago .
In the United States , much of the attention in the third quarter has focused on a deal that failed to come to fru@@ ition - the planned IPO of WeWork parent We Company .
Having aimed to launch its IPO earlier in September , the company postponed plans to list until later in 2019 , before replacing its chief executive officer and saying it was reviewing its timet@@ able to go public .
En@@ de@@ avor Group Holdings ( ED@@ R.@@ N ) , an entertainment and talent agency company backed by Hollywood power bro@@ ker Ar@@ i E@@ manuel with a track record of losses , made a last-@@ minute decision to abandon its IPO due to the tough market conditions . Taking a lesson from the struggles earlier in 2019 of ri@@ de-@@ ha@@ iling companies Uber Technologies ( UB@@ ER@@ .@@ N ) and Lyft Inc ( L@@ Y@@ FT@@ .@@ O ) , which have no stated timet@@ able for becoming profitable , investors have started to push back on companies with a history of steep losses . " It will be a dialogue among bank@@ ers and boards and senior management teams where they say , " these were isolated and not compar@@ able , " or say " we have a sentiment shift and we need to be more conservative and use a different strategy , " " said David Eth@@ ridge , U.S. IPO services leader at audit firm P@@ w@@ C . The market was more recep@@ tive to les@@ ser@@ -@@ known names such as cy@@ ber security company P@@ ing Ident@@ ity P@@ ING@@ .@@ N and cloud monitoring company Dat@@ ado@@ g Inc D@@ DO@@ G.@@ O. Both companies have reported more modest losses and rely on selling to companies rather than to consumers .
Jonathan Van N@@ ess Just H@@ ung Out With Nancy Pelosi And They 've Got A Plan
" Que@@ er Eye " star Jonathan Van N@@ ess stru@@ tted his stuff on Capitol Hill on Thursday , joining forces with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-@@ Calif . ) to discuss the E@@ quality Act .
The E@@ quality Act would extend non@@ discrimination protections to LGBTQ individuals in credit , education , employment , housing , federal financial assistance , jury service and public accommod@@ ations .
The bill would am@@ end the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sexual ori@@ entation and gender identity to the list of already protected classes .
Van N@@ ess , who recently publicly came out as HIV positive , first shared a video of himself cat@@ -@@ walking in the Capitol , explaining in his caption that he 'd met with the House speaker to talk E@@ quality Act , living with HIV and access to Pr@@ EP ( an HIV prevent@@ ative medication ) :
He then shared a longer post pic@@ turing the two of them arm in arm , urging his followers to stand up to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-@@ K@@ y . ) and apply pressure to GOP senators to bring the E@@ quality Act up for a Senate vote :
Pelosi introduced the E@@ quality Act on March 13 . The House passed the legislation in May . It has not yet been brought to the Senate floor .
In August , the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to essentially leg@@ alize anti-@@ gay discrimination in the workplace , arguing in an am@@ ic@@ us brief that the federal laws on employer discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were not intended to protect individuals from being fired based on their sexual ori@@ entation .
Pelosi met earlier this year with Van N@@ ess and three of his " Que@@ er Eye " co-@@ stars as well as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-@@ N.Y. ) , to talk policy and promote the bill .
On Thursday , Pelosi shared her own image of herself and Van N@@ ess war@@ mly holding hands on a balcon@@ y , than@@ king him for bringing his voice to the fight :
David Atten@@ borough working on new documentary about animals and colour
David Atten@@ borough is 9@@ 3-@@ year@@ s-@@ old but the iconic nature g@@ uru is not slowing down just yet .
No , after the success of his ground@@ breaking Netflix documentary Our Planet , the much loved star is set to return with another series : Life In Col@@ our .
This time , the fa@@ ther@@ -of-@@ two will look at how animals use colour in their lives through high-@@ tech cameras that were built especially for the programme .
The BBC have revealed that the star aims to show " a world of colour normally inv@@ is@@ ible to human eyes " - and it sounds truly fascinating .
However , despite fans being eager for the upcoming release , it seems we all need to sit tight as it won 't be dropping on our screens until 2021 .
But we 're sure it 'll be worth the wait .
Earlier this month , David was presented with the TV Cho@@ ice Life@@ time Ach@@ ie@@ vement Award , at the pre@@ stig@@ ious ceremony in London .
The national treas@@ ure has enter@@ tained millions over his career , which has so far spann@@ ed 60 years .
When collecting his g@@ ong , the reporter enth@@ used : " Indeed . What I do isn 't always entertaining , and sometimes people hear things they don 't like !
" But this is an honour and a great pleasure . "
TV Cho@@ ice said of the winner : " Still working , learning and making programmes Sir David Atten@@ borough isn 't just a British hero , he 's a global icon . "
This week , David was celebrated once again as a pol@@ ar research ship was named after him .
The star joined both Prince William and Kate for the nam@@ ing ceremony in C@@ amm@@ ell L@@ air@@ d ship@@ yard in Bir@@ ken@@ head , Merseyside .
He said : " It 's no news to any of you that the world is facing great , great problems and the most aware of that are the young people of today , who will inher@@ it this world .
" Great problems require great research and facts in order to solve them .
" That 's what this aston@@ ishing ship will be here to do , to find out the facts and find the science with which to deal with problems that are facing the world today and will increasingly do so tomorrow . "
Life In Col@@ our is expected to air on BBC Two in 2021 , while it 's said Netflix will retain global rights .
Don 't use my wife 's name to score points , says husband of murdered MP Jo Cox
The husband of Jo Cox said his wife 's name must not be used to score political points after Jeremy Corbyn last night posted footage of the murdered MP to critic@@ ise Boris Johnson .
The Labour leader 's film featured cli@@ ps of Mrs Cox and a vig@@ il held after her death , with the caption : " Boris Johnson does not care about violence on our streets . "
Critics said Mr Corbyn was using her murder to score " cheap political points " while her husband Brendan Cox said the Labour leader was " wrong " to inf@@ er hat@@ eful language was a " simple party political issue . "
Mr Cox said : " Jeremy is right that the best way to honour Jo is to defeat hatred and division . He 's also right the PM has a particular responsibility .
" But he 's wrong to inf@@ er this is a simple party political issue . Jo was passi@@ on@@ ately Labour but some things must tran@@ sc@@ end party politics . "
He also shared a post which said Jo Cox 's name was " more than a political scoring point " with the caption " This . Thank you . " Mr Corbyn was facing a backlash for his video which opens with him talking about Mrs Cox 's murder three years ago by a far-@@ Right activist in her West Yorkshire constituency .
Speaking over a mon@@ tage of cli@@ ps of Mrs Cox , Mr Johnson and female MPs , Mr Corbyn said : " This Prime Minister knows these words can promote violence and have real consequences . He wants division . Cle@@ arly , he doesn 't care about the violence on our streets . "
He goes on to critic@@ ise Mr Johnson and call for a Labour government .
Mr Corbyn added : " Many are deeply concerned about the language used by Boris Johnson , language which is being repeated by the far-@@ Right . When this was raised with him by women MPs , who themselves face death threats , he arrogan@@ tly dismissed them . It was nothing short of disgr@@ aceful . " Former Labour MP John Wood@@ cock shared the video and said : " You can really shut up . Dis@@ gu@@ sting . "
Meanwhile Tory MP and business minister Nad@@ him Za@@ haw@@ i said : " You are so wrong to use Jo Cox in this way , when her family have specifically asked for her not to be used in this way . To be kept out of politics .
" If you have an o@@ unce of dec@@ ency Jeremy Corbyn you would take this video down . " It follows a row over language in Parliament this week in which Mr Johnson said that the " best way " to honour Mrs Cox was to " get Brexit done . " Her sister Kim Lead@@ be@@ ater called for a di@@ alling down of extreme language saying it was " not helpful to Jo 's kids . "
She told ITV : " For me to come out and say ou@@ trag@@ eous things about Boris Johnson - I just don 't think that 's a useful way of moving forward . I can say what I think is right and what I think is wrong but I 'm going to try and do that in a measured manner . "
The daughter of Labour MP Y@@ v@@ ette Cooper spoke out yesterday to say she constantly fears for her mother 's life because of the way people speak about politicians .
House re@@ bu@@ kes Trump on border wall , but he plans ve@@ to
The Democr@@ ati@@ c-@@ controlled House is making a second attempt to over@@ turn President Donald Trump 's use of emergency powers to raid military base projects such as schools and target ran@@ ges to pay for his long-@@ promised border fence .
The 23@@ 6-@@ 17@@ 4 vote sent the legislation to Trump , who is sure to ve@@ to it just as he killed a similar measure in March .
The Senate passed the measure last week with about a dozen veteran Republican lawmakers re@@ bu@@ king Trump .
Friday 's vote was different because it followed the recent release by the administration of a list of 12@@ 7 military construction projects total@@ ing $ 3.@@ 6 billion that will be canceled to pay for the border wall , including numerous projects in GOP districts and states .
Brazil says oil in sp@@ ill along northeast beaches not Brazilian
Brazil 's environmental agency I@@ b@@ ama said on Thursday that an analysis of a vast oil sp@@ ill along the country 's nor@@ theastern beaches showed the sp@@ illed crude did not origin@@ ate in the country .
I@@ b@@ ama said in a statement that it had been investigating the sp@@ ill in several beaches in some nor@@ theastern states since Sept . 2 . Local media showed pictures of sea tur@@ t@@ les co@@ ated in black tar by the s@@ lick .
The sp@@ ill sp@@ ans over 1,500 kilometers ( 9@@ 32 miles ) of Brazil 's northeast coast , affecting wildlife and pollu@@ ting some of the post@@ card beaches in one of the nation 's top tour@@ istic destinations , such as Pra@@ ia do Fut@@ uro , in the state of C@@ ear@@ a , and Mar@@ ag@@ og@@ i , in Al@@ ago@@ as state .
Brazil 's state-@@ controlled oil company Petro@@ le@@ o Br@@ as@@ il@@ eiro SA said in a statement that it had concluded after a molec@@ ular analysis of the oil that the crude sp@@ illed was not produced nor sold by the company .
Cru@@ de oil is tested before export to make sure it comp@@ lies with the standards of the refin@@ ery it is being shi@@ pped to . Cru@@ de oil from different fields can be identified according to a series of chemical sign@@ atures , including levels of sul@@ fur and nit@@ ro@@ gen , ac@@ idity and vis@@ co@@ sity .
The head of Brazil 's oil agency AN@@ P Dec@@ io Od@@ done said the agency believes the oil could have been sp@@ illed by a tanker transpor@@ ting the crude far from the Brazilian coast , but added this possibility has not yet been confirmed yet . An AN@@ P statement said there were no reports of sp@@ ills by any operator of oil dr@@ illing ri@@ gs in the country .
Some marine tur@@ t@@ les were contam@@ inated by the oil . They were rescued alive in the state of Rio Grande do Nor@@ te and sent to rehabil@@ itation centers . Other animals were found dead , I@@ b@@ ama said , without dis@@ closing species or numbers .
Petro@@ br@@ as , as the state oil company is known , said in a statement that even though it was not involved in the sp@@ ill it was contributing to the cle@@ an-@@ up efforts , with some 100 Petro@@ br@@ as employees helping clean the beaches .
S@@ ko@@ da to provide drivers with voice activ@@ ated digital assistant
S@@ ko@@ da is to introduce a digital assistant that can be activ@@ ated with a verbal command . In an announcement Wednesday , the Czech car maker said the digital assistant could be activ@@ ated by the phrase " Ok@@ ay , Laura . "
The system , which supports six languages , is able to under@@ take a range of tasks including starting nav@@ igation to a destination and searching for music . It will initially be available in models of the Kam@@ i@@ q city SUV and the comp@@ act S@@ cal@@ a . Part of the Volkswagen Group since 1991 , the S@@ ko@@ da brand delivered 1.@@ 25 million vehicles globally in 2018 , according to its annual report .
The company 's introduction of a virtual , voice activ@@ ated assistant mir@@ rors efforts by other manufacturers in the sector . Some BMW cars , for instance , are now equipped with an " intelligent personal assistant " which can be activ@@ ated by using a button , a personal activ@@ ation word or the phrase " H@@ ello , BMW . " Verb@@ al comm@@ ands can be used to , among other things , activ@@ ate seat heating , get information on ti@@ re pressure , and adjust the in-@@ car temperature .
" Voice is the ideal interaction tool in the vehicle , " Jack Palmer , a senior connected car specialist at S@@ B@@ D Autom@@ otive , said in a statement sent to CNBC via email on Thursday .
" If the lion 's share of comm@@ ands from the driver can be in@@ put@@ ted through virtual assist@@ ants , rather than fi@@ ddling around with touch@@ screens and but@@ tons , the current epidemic of driver distr@@ action will be greatly mitig@@ ated , " Palmer added . " Autom@@ akers have realized this and the race is on for them to integr@@ ate their own solutions or partner with consumer electron@@ ics companies such as Google and Amazon . "
The moves by firms such as S@@ ko@@ da and BMW point to a potential shift in the way people interact with their cars . Hannah K@@ esh@@ ish@@ ian , an autom@@ otive analyst at market intelligence firm Min@@ tel , told CNBC via email that one of its recent reports had highlighted how nearly 40 % of U.S. consumers who owned a vehicle " would like to use a digital personal assistant in their vehicle . " This , she added , " opens the door to greater pos@@ sibilities for digital assistant vehicle connec@@ tivity . "
Ghana : World Rab@@ ies Day Ob@@ served
The 13th World Rab@@ ies Day was marked in Ac@@ cr@@ a on Wednesday with a call on pet owners to vacc@@ in@@ ate their dogs in order to safe@@ guard the lives of the citi@@ zen@@ ry .
The programme which was held under the theme " Rab@@ ies : Vacc@@ in@@ ate to eliminate " was organised by the Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FA@@ O ) in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture Veter@@ inary Service .
It was aimed at highligh@@ ting the essential role of mass can@@ ine vaccination in rab@@ ies elim@@ ination in the country .
Ad@@ dressing the conference , the Assistant Director General and FA@@ O Representative to Ghana , Mr Abe@@ be H@@ ail@@ e-@@ Gabriel indicated that the issue of rab@@ ies could be minim@@ ised if efforts were ge@@ ared towards vaccination and keeping stra@@ y animals away from humans especially children .
According to him , the ' Zero by 30 ' Global Strate@@ gic Plan " of the 500,000 people who died from rab@@ ies each year , 40 per cent are children living in Asia and Africa , " and called for holi@@ stic approach to deal with the situation to save kids from rab@@ ies .
Mr H@@ ail@@ e-@@ Gabriel stated that most stra@@ y animals carried rab@@ ies and re-@@ echoed the need for the country to supp@@ lement the United against Rab@@ ies 2030 strategy that requires the pet owners to vacc@@ in@@ ate animals that carried zo@@ on@@ otic diseases .
He under@@ scored the need for the country to embar@@ k on five-year campaign and vaccination programme to create awareness to eliminate potential exposure of human to rab@@ ies .
A comprehensive road@@ map for progressive elim@@ ination of rab@@ ies , he noted had been rolled out through the Ghana Rab@@ ies and Prevention Action Plan ( 2018-@@ 2030 ) to end epidem@@ ics of negle@@ cted tropical diseases by 2030 .
Mr H@@ ail@@ e-@@ Gabriel pledged the read@@ iness of the FA@@ O to collabor@@ ate with other stakeholders in preventing and controlling rab@@ ies in the country .
Dr Owen Kal@@ u@@ wa , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) Representative to Ghana observed that rab@@ ies was an en@@ dem@@ ic which had to be controlled to save lives .
He explained that through the " Zero human rab@@ ies deaths by 2030 " strategy , countries were supported to develop and implement their national rab@@ ies elim@@ ination plans that embrace the One Health Conc@@ ept and cross sec@@ toral collaboration .
Dr Kal@@ u@@ wa noted that 99 per cent of zo@@ on@@ otic disease like rab@@ ies was trans@@ mitted from dogs to humans , adding that One Health approach to controlling and ultimately elimin@@ ating human rab@@ ies was expe@@ dient .
Director of Veter@@ inary Service , Dr Asi@@ ed@@ u Ba@@ ah lam@@ ented that rab@@ ies had become global burden .
" Though rab@@ ies has no cure , the infection is vaccine prevent@@ able , h@@ ence its elim@@ ination is fe@@ as@@ ible therefore any animal owner must ensure their animals are vaccinated , " he stated .
Dr Ba@@ ah said although rab@@ ies was fully prevent@@ able using appropriate sustainable control strategies , lack of funds and concer@@ ted efforts had continued to result in escalation of human death and the spread of the en@@ dem@@ ic .
" It is imper@@ ative that the animal sector is adequ@@ ately re@@ sourced to prevent transmission of rab@@ ies in dogs as a protective measure against the disease , " he added .
The 12@@ -year-old who " sil@@ enced the world "
Greta Thunberg has established herself as the planet 's spokeswoman on climate change at the tender age of 16 . But long before social media , another teenager was sc@@ ol@@ ding UN leaders on the world stage 27 years ago .
In the year since she organized school wal@@ k@@ outs in her native Sweden to protest climate change , Greta Thunberg 's environmental cr@@ us@@ ade has been un@@ avo@@ idable , cul@@ min@@ ating on Monday in an angry and passionate speech before the UN 's Climate Action Summit , in which she lam@@ b@@ asted politicians for stealing her " dreams " and her " childhood " with " empty words " while humanity sta@@ res down " a mass ex@@ tinction . "
Thunberg 's grim prono@@ unc@@ ements have earned her sav@@ age criticism , and g@@ lowing praise . New York Magazine called her " the Joan of Ar@@ c of climate change , " while The Guardian ranked her speech alongside President Lincoln 's Get@@ ty@@ s@@ burg Ad@@ dress for its historical significance .
Then again , they said the same about Sever@@ n Cul@@ l@@ is-@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki in 1992 . Long before Thunberg dead@@ p@@ anned to par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ari@@ ans that " we probably don 't even have a future any more , " and ne@@ ti@@ zens t@@ ore each other to sh@@ reds attacking and defending her , 12@@ -year-old Cul@@ l@@ is-@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki became known as the " The girl who sil@@ enced the world for five minutes " when she delivered a similar ser@@ mon before the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
The tone of Cul@@ l@@ is-@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki 's speech is stri@@ k@@ ingly similar to Thunberg 's . " We 've come ... to tell you adults that you must change your ways , " she opened , just like Thunberg told the assem@@ bled adults " we will not let you get away with this . "
Just as Thunberg told the UN summit " we are in the beginning of a mass ex@@ tinction and all you can talk about is the money and fair@@ y@@ tal@@ es of e@@ ternal economic growth , " Cul@@ l@@ is-@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki told leaders that " losing my future is not like losing an election or a few points on the stock market . "
And under@@ p@@ inning both girls " messages was a n@@ ih@@ ili@@ stic fat@@ alism . " I am afraid to go out in the sun now because of the hole in our o@@ zone . I am afraid to breathe the air because I don 't know what chemicals are in it , " Cul@@ l@@ is-@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki said in 1992 . Stri@@ king school@@ children in 2019 carry bann@@ ers reading " You 'll die of old age , I 'll die of climate change . "
The environmental problems addressed by Cul@@ l@@ is-@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki reflect the world of the early 1990s , when de@@ fore@@ station , the de@@ ple@@ tion of the o@@ zone layer , and the ex@@ tinction of species were the ec@@ ological concerns de j@@ our . Yet humanity has been fairly successful at resol@@ ving those problems in the inter@@ vening years . Thanks to a landmark chemicals ban , o@@ zone de@@ ple@@ tion has slowed dramatically , and forest cover worldwide has increased by an area the size of Texas and Alaska combined .
Cul@@ l@@ is-@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki herself went on to found an environmental think tank and work for UN Secretary General Ko@@ fi Ann@@ an 's Special Advisory Panel in the early 200@@ 0s .
So what does the future have in store for Thunberg ? Well that depends how you look at Cul@@ l@@ is-@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki 's example . On one hand , none of her worst fears came to pass . On the other , world governments still have ec@@ ological problems to cont@@ end with , and are still being lec@@ tured by children about them .
As@@ sum@@ ing the world as we know it still exists 27 years from now - as Thunberg says it won 't unless we s@@ lash carbon emissions to absolute zero in the next decade or so - then the teenage activist will likely look back on a long UN and N@@ GO career that kicked off with one famous speech .
By then , another concerned child will likely be delivering a passionate warning about acid rain in the Mar@@ tian colon@@ ies .
SNP could support Jeremy Corbyn as temporary PM to stop no-deal Brexit
The SNP has sign@@ alled it could support inst@@ alling Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street on a temporary basis to th@@ wart a no-deal Brexit .
As tensions between MPs and Downing Street deep@@ ened , Nicola Sturgeon suggested it could row in behind the Labour leader as a care@@ taker prime minister until a general election .
Mr Corbyn called on re@@ bel Tories and opposition MPs to back him to lead a temporary administration in August - but the move was met with resistance , particularly from the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson .
Under the proposals , opposition parties would seek to ou@@ st Boris Johnson in a vote of no confidence and then form a unity government that would seek an extension to prevent the UK cr@@ ashing out of the EU on 31 October .
The plan failed to gain cross-@@ party support at the time , but senior figures in the SNP are concerned that Mr Johnson could def@@ y a law forcing him to delay Brexit if there is no deal in place before 19 October .
Nicola Sturgeon , the SNP leader , suggested that Mr Corbyn could be brought in to secure the extension as leaving Mr Johnson in charge would be a " terrible idea . "
Respon@@ ding to a tweet suggesting inst@@ alling the Labour leader or another temporary prime minister , she said : " Agre@@ e with this .
" Vote of no confidence , opposition un@@ ites around someone for sole purpose of securing an extension , and then immediate general election .
" Nothing is risk free but leaving Johnson in post to force through no deal - or even a bad deal - seems like a terrible idea to me . "
Veteran MPs Harriet Har@@ man and Ken Clarke have both been named as potential figures to lead a unity government but a senior SNP source insisted it had to be the Labour leader .
" It is increasingly clear that we will have to install a new prime minister via a vote of no confidence , so that we can request a delay to Brexit and hold an election , " the source told ITV 's Robert P@@ est@@ on .
" Tr@@ ying to find a compromise candidate , a national unity candidate , is too complicated , especially in the time we have . Whether people like it or not , the temporary prime minister has to be Corbyn . "
An SNP spokesperson said the party was committed to stopping a no-deal Brexit and removing " this dangerous and un@@ democratic prime minister as soon as possible . "
The spokesperson said : " It is now possible - if the political will is there - that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of Boris Johnson and his cr@@ on@@ ies , who are determined to find a way to get around the Ben@@ n Act , but is instead sent by a temporary care@@ taker prime minister , who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter , with an election held immediately afterwards .
" We remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a no-deal Brexit and getting rid of Boris Johnson . "
Even with SNP support , it would come down to a kni@@ fe@@ -@@ edge vote for Mr Corbyn . There are 28@@ 8 Tory MPs , as well as 10 Democratic Union@@ ists , so the opposition would need some of the 34 independent MPs to come on board .
Labour argued that the plan was the " sim@@ pl@@ est and most democratic way to stop no deal . "
However the Liberal Democrats believe a temporary government led by Mr Corbyn cannot achieve the necessary support across the House , as he would need the backing of ex-@@ Tory MPs and def@@ ec@@ tors from his own party .
Kir@@ st@@ ene H@@ air , Tory MP for Angus , said : " This report confirms what many have long suspected - SNP MPs will happ@@ ily pro@@ p up Jeremy Corbyn in No@@ 10 .
" There is no doubt that Corbyn 's weak stance on ind@@ y@@ ref@@ 2 is a deciding factor for the nation@@ alists .
" He has already left the door open for a re-@@ run of the 2014 referendum if he becomes prime minister .
" Only a Conservative government will stand up for those who voted " No " in what was meant to be a once in a generation event . "
Over 50 Surrey University students banned from sports teams amid accusations of sexual harassment
" People are just doing everything you would expect from a l@@ ads holiday . It is accepted that this is an alcohol heavy , rau@@ c@@ ous trip . "
However , students said that this year behaviour of some students went too far , particularly during a game which involved members of the football club being da@@ red by their teammates to make advances on women , while their friends attempt to " inter@@ c@@ ept " them .
Alan Su@@ ther@@ land , chief executive of Surrey 's student unions said : " We became aware of the misconduct , and as investigations proce@@ e@@ ded any individual students who were accused of committing a " major " offence as per the student disciplinary regulations were referred to a university investigation . "
Three students were formally discipl@@ ined by the university , which launched its own investigation into the football team 's conduct .
One student was exp@@ elled for three counts of sexual misconduct or harassment , and one count of aggressive behaviour .
Meanwhile two other students , who were also accused of harassment , were issued with final warnings and made to issue ap@@ ologies .
One was banned from University premises at certain times and the other was banned from attending organised social events . All three students were banned from attending their gradu@@ ation cer@@ emon@@ ies .
The Surrey University men 's football club said that they " sinc@@ er@@ ely apologise " for its members actions during the Cro@@ atia tour .
Matt de Gro@@ od shouldn 't be punished because of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia stig@@ ma
In 2016 , Matthew de Gro@@ od , the man who killed five people at a house party in Cal@@ g@@ ary , was found to be not crimin@@ ally responsible for his actions .
Now , in 2019 , there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freed@@ oms , such as un@@ super@@ vised out@@ ings . The decision won 't come for a few more weeks , so in the meantime we 're left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea . There are two sides to this : one citing his violent behaviour in the past , calling to prevent it from happening again , and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabil@@ itation .
First , let 's examine the more p@@ essi@@ mist@@ ic side . De Gro@@ od did stab and kill five people during a psy@@ cho@@ tic break . It was a violent and un@@ predictable attack . He suff@@ ers from sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia , which is why he was found not crimin@@ ally responsible , but has since been seeing a psychiat@@ rist and taking his medication . His psychiat@@ rist , Dr. San@@ to@@ ch Ra@@ i , has said in front of the review board that " if Matthew de Gro@@ od were to commit another offence , it would be severe . " Despite his perceived improvement , there is still risk of re-@@ offense . But is this reason enough to remain afraid ? Is it enough to keep de Gro@@ od locked up ?
As long as de Gro@@ od continues to take his medication , there isn 't a huge risk of re@@ offense , so why are people so concerned ? I believe the stig@@ ma surrounding people with mental illness , particularly those with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia , largely influ@@ ences this fear . Cer@@ tain mental illnesses have become less stig@@ m@@ ati@@ zed , such as mood and anxiety disorders . But others , including sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia , remain highly stig@@ m@@ ati@@ zed . This is in large part due to numerous portra@@ y@@ als of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people .
That was the case in this situation , but these instances are rare , and that 's perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur . In fact , the majority of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ic individuals are non@@ violent , and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpet@@ rators of crime or violence . In light of this , it seems un@@ reasonable to insist that de Gro@@ od be denied certain freed@@ oms when the fear of re-@@ offense is based more on a pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed attitude towards people with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia than actual likelihood .
I don 't believe de Gro@@ od should ever be un@@ super@@ vised permanently . A par@@ ol@@ e-@@ like system where he has to check in to make sure he 's still taking his medication could work well . Ar@@ gu@@ ing that he or other mentally ill people remain institution@@ alized unless absolutely necessary is a form of se@@ gregation . It perpet@@ u@@ ates the idea that mentally ill people , those with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia in particular , cannot ever mes@@ h with society ; thus continuing the stig@@ ma and perpet@@ u@@ ating the idea that they are dangerous criminals . He was found not crimin@@ ally responsible by a court of law , so why should he be treated like a pris@@ oner instead of someone who was ill and is now better ?
Hung@@ arian PM Or@@ ban def@@ ends his candidate for EU executive , " has solutions in pocket "
Prime Minister Vik@@ tor Or@@ ban has said he has several solutions " in his pocket " after Hungary 's candidate for the European Commission was rejected .
The EU transport commission@@ er-@@ design@@ ate , Roman@@ ian socialist politician Ro@@ v@@ ana Pl@@ um@@ b , and the proposed commissioner for EU en@@ lar@@ gement , former Hung@@ arian justice minister Las@@ z@@ lo Tro@@ c@@ s@@ any@@ i , were told their confirmation hearings could not go ahead because of in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies in their financial statements , Reuters reported .
" I am convinced that [ Tro@@ c@@ s@@ any@@ i ] is the most suitable candidate for becoming member of the European Commission , " Or@@ ban said . " His sin was that he helped the government and me ... to protect Hungary from migration . "
The move is seen as an embarrass@@ ment for Or@@ ban , who proposed Tro@@ c@@ s@@ any@@ i , and who has been in constant conflict with Brussels over his migration policy and other issues .
Bab@@ ies on a plane : Japan Airlines unvei@@ ls tool to tackle horror of screaming inf@@ ants
Being stuck on a long-@@ haul flight within ear@@ shot of a crying baby could be a thing of the past for passengers on Japan Airlines ( J@@ AL ) , after the carrier unveiled an online booking tool that indicates where todd@@ lers will be se@@ ated .
When passengers with children aged between eight days and two years old reserve their seat , a child icon automatically appears on the seat plan , aler@@ ting other passengers who have yet to select their seats .
J@@ AL was quick to point out that the new feature did not guarantee that passengers would be out of ear@@ shot of a screaming inf@@ ant .
The icon would not appear if passengers booked their flight through a third party or were part of a tour group , or if there was a last-@@ minute change of aircraft , the airline 's website said .
J@@ AL and other airlines have yet to come up with way of anticip@@ ating seat re@@ servations by ser@@ ial s@@ nor@@ ers and passengers who fully rec@@ line their seats during in-@@ flight meals .
But the move attracted praise from some social media users .
" Thank you , @ J@@ AL _ Off@@ icial _ j@@ p for warnings me about where babies plan to scre@@ am and y@@ ell during a 13 hour trip , " Rah@@ at Ahmed , a businessman , tweeted . " This really ought to be mandatory across the board . "
Others , though , cast@@ ig@@ ated travellers for in@@ tolerance towards fellow passengers .
" They are babies , as we all once were . We need to learn tolerance or will soon start needing a map of seat locations for mouth breath@@ ers , dro@@ ol@@ ers , far@@ ters , dr@@ un@@ ks , and perhaps a lot more things in life , " one user said .
Pompeo acc@@ uses Syria of using chemical weapons in May attack
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , speaking on the sidel@@ ines of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday , said the United States has concluded the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year .
Pompeo said U.S. officials had determined Syrian President Bash@@ ar Assad 's government had used chlor@@ ine in the attack on opposition forces in Idlib province on May 19 .
" The Assad regime is responsible for inn@@ um@@ er@@ able atro@@ cities some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity , " Pompeo told a news conference .
U.S. officials in May said they 'd received reports consistent with a chemical attack in north@@ west Syria but did not offer a defin@@ itive conclusion at the time .
In April 2018 , the U.S. , Britain and France launched air@@ strikes in Syria in retali@@ ation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month .
" This is different in some sense because it was chlor@@ ine ... but know that President Trump has been pretty vig@@ orous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons , " Pompeo said .
He added that the U.S. would provide an additional $ 4.5 million to the Organization for the Pro@@ hib@@ ition of Chem@@ ical We@@ ap@@ ons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected Syrian chem@@ ic@@ al-@@ weapons use .
Pompeo also called on the Assad government to release thousands of un@@ just@@ ly detained prisoners , including American journalist Austin T@@ ice , who has been missing and presum@@ ed held by the government for seven years .
" He is just one of a number of American citizens held in Syria and we call upon the Syrian regime to release them all . "
Tesla jum@@ ps on report Musk aims to deliver 100,000 cars this quarter
Elon Musk , co-founder and chief executive officer of Tesla Motors .
Shares of Tesla jumped more than 5 % after Elec@@ tre@@ k , an electric vehicle news website , reported that CEO Elon Musk said the company " has a shot " at delivering 100,000 cars this quarter , which would be a new record .
Elec@@ tre@@ k attributed the update to a leaked email from Musk sent to his employees at Tesla . Musk wrote in the email : " We have a shot at achieving our first 100,000 vehicle delivery quarter , which is an incredibly exciting milestone for our company ! "
The CEO also reportedly added , " The challenge is making sure that we have the right car vari@@ ants in the right locations and rall@@ ying as much as our company resources as possible to help with the end of the quarter deliveries . "
The autom@@ aker is expected to report its quarterly vehicle deliveries in the next few days .
Last quarter , Tesla delivered approximately 9@@ 5,000 electric vehicles .
Greece : 5 deny poor women 's babies sold in illegal ad@@ options
Five Greek and Georgi@@ an citizens have appeared in court on charges of belong@@ ing to a criminal organization that allegedly sold babies for adoption .
All five denied the charges before a Th@@ ess@@ al@@ on@@ ik@@ i mag@@ ist@@ rate on Friday . The two Georgi@@ an nationals are accused of being the ring@@ leaders .
The gang allegedly recru@@ ited pregnant Bulgar@@ ian women who were dest@@ itute and willing to give up new@@ bor@@ ns they might deliver . Authorities say the group sold babies to child@@ less Greek couples .
A total 12 people were arrested this week in connection with the alleged illegal ad@@ options and the alleged sale of human eggs . Another 54 have been charged with compli@@ city .
Police say it was one of the biggest and best-@@ organized gangs of its kind in Europe . The continent 's Euro@@ po@@ l police agency assisted the investigation .
Mike Pompeo says Syrian government used chlor@@ ine in May chemical weapon attack
Mike Pompeo , the US Secretary of State , said on Thursday that the United States had concluded the Syrian government had used chlor@@ ine as a chemical weapon in an attack in May during a battle with insur@@ g@@ ents in Idlib .
" The Assad regime is responsible for inn@@ um@@ er@@ able atro@@ cities , some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity , " Mr Pompeo told a news conference in New York , where he has been attending the United Nations General Assembly .
" Today I am announcing that the United States has concluded that the Assad regime used chlor@@ ine as a chemical weapon on May 19 , " Mr Pompeo added .
The United States said in May it had received numerous reports that appeared consistent with chemical exposure after an attack by the forces of Bash@@ ar al-@@ Assad , the Syrian president , in north@@ western Syria , but it had made no defin@@ itive conclusion as to whether they used chemical weapons .
The Trump administration has twice bom@@ bed Syria over Assad 's suspected use of chemical weapons , in April 2017 and April 2018 .
Father Rem@@ ains Hop@@ eful That Sus@@ p@@ ect Who Fat@@ ally Sho@@ t Son One Year A@@ go Will Be Cau@@ ght
It 's been one year since a 20@@ -year-old from Long Beach was fat@@ ally shot , but the victim 's family isn 't giving up hope that the shooter will be caught .
" I wish I could trade places with you son , I wish I could trade places with you , " Guy Al@@ ford , the victim 's father , said .
Al@@ ford came back to the scene of the crime exactly one year after his son , Guy Al@@ ford III , was gun@@ ned down at a Jack In The Box near 5@@ 2nd and Atlantic . He said he wanted to call attention to his son 's un@@ solved murder .
" Some@@ body knows something , they need to say something , " he said .
Security video , which has never been released , showed Al@@ ford stopped in the drive-@@ thr@@ u when a second car pulled up behind him . Three suspects were then seen getting out of that car . One of them walked up to the driver 's side , and shot Al@@ ford . The four people in Al@@ ford 's car jumped out and ran . The suspects were then seen getting back into their car and driving away .
" W@@ her@@ ever this co@@ ward is , he will get caught , " Al@@ ford said .
This grie@@ ving father said he has no idea who would want to hurt his son , and he said he still didn 't know who was in the car with him when he was shot .
" They u@@ pped and ran out of my son 's car like that , where did you run to , " Al@@ ford said . " Did you go back and try to help him or what ? Nobody said nothing . "
Al@@ ford said his son was a star football player at Ale@@ many High School , then a stand@@ -out safety on the Long Beach City College football team . Al@@ ford said his son was working toward playing for a Division 1 school and had dreams of becoming a nurse .
" He was working three jobs , " Michael Harvey , a friend , said . " As somebody who 's 21 , he was a year younger than me , anybody with that type of h@@ ust@@ le and work eth@@ ic , you tend to look up to . "
As the investigation into the fatal shooting continues , Al@@ ford said he wasn 't giving up either .
" I can ass@@ ure you , this one is going to get solved , " he said .
Al@@ ford is personally offering a $ 2,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction . Anyone with information about this crime is urged to call Long Beach police .
Brexit can get plenty more toxic from here
Hum@@ ili@@ ation in the courts at home is a taste of what a@@ waits Johnson in Brussels if he tries to we@@ as@@ el out of his commitments to request an extension . That will comfort European officials , who would most probably agree to it . Main@@ ly because taking more time to find a solution reduc@@ es the threat of a no-deal Brexit , which would be econom@@ ically harmful to both sides .
Yet European diplomats can also see that the political bed@@ lam in the UK l@@ ends itself to delay without decisions . Law@@ makers in Parliament were able to set aside their differences to tie Johnson 's hands and seek an extension , but that 's about all they can agree on . This is the same Parliament that rejected the former prime minister Theresa May 's hard-@@ fought Brexit deal with the EU three times . Un@@ less there 's an election - another decision on which MPs have a final say - that won 't change .
But even an election is a grim prospect for European capit@@ als hoping for a friendly resolution to the Brexit mess . The opposition Labour Party 's Brexit policy is a painful cont@@ or@@ tion act that 's almost impossible to understand ; the centr@@ ist Liberal Democrats ' idea to cancel Brexit altogether is seen as extreme . The longer this dr@@ ags on , the more it e@@ ats away at the smooth functioning of the EU .
There might be more optimism in Brussels if the out@@ line of a work@@ able deal was already sitting on a desk somewhere in the European Commission 's Ber@@ lay@@ mont headquarters . But there isn 't .
Johnson 's regular b@@ ashing of his predecessor 's " backstop " proposal to avoid a return to a hard border in Ireland and protect the EU single market hasn 't led to any convincing alternatives . Officials say the proposals sent in by the UK on alternative arrangements aren 't concrete enough to be considered operational in time for an October 31 exit .
And Johnson 's weakness will give the 27 leaders facing him even less incen@@ tive to er@@ ase crucial red lines , despite the claim by Michael Gove , the UK minister in charge of a no-deal Brexit , that they 're " shifting " on the backstop .
In an ideal world , a series of blo@@ ws landing on Johnson - who is also under fire over his rhetoric in the debate over Brexit - would bring the match closer to an end . Europe should still try to extr@@ act maximum conc@@ essions from the UK , given it has no choice but to negotiate with the current government while trying to preserve unity among the rest of its 27 member states - which is going to get harder the longer this dr@@ ags on . If there 's a window to try yet again to put a deal before the UK parliament , the EU should grab it .
But this is more like a soccer match with 27 players on one side lining up to defend while the player in the opposite team tries to pick up the ball and go home .
The EU is good at setting rules and red lines and sticking to them ; it 's less good at un@@ ilater@@ ally imposing its will . The UK is hem@@ med in by its own internal contradic@@ tions , at least until an election or a second referendum breaks the imp@@ asse .
Brexit can get plenty more toxic from here .
Black hole s@@ wal@@ lowing and ri@@ pping apart star captured for first time
A gig@@ anti@@ c black hole has been captured pulling in and ri@@ pping apart a star for the first time .
The star , which was about the same size as our sun , was seen from 3@@ 75 million light years away war@@ ping and spir@@ alling into the gra@@ vit@@ ational pull of a super@@ massive black hole , researchers said in the Astro@@ physical Journal .
It was then su@@ cked into obli@@ vi@@ on in a rare co@@ sm@@ ic occurr@@ ence astron@@ omers call a ti@@ dal disruption event .
NASA 's plan@@ et-@@ searching tel@@ es@@ cope , the Trans@@ iting Ex@@ op@@ lan@@ et Survey Satell@@ ite - T@@ ES@@ S - captured the detailed timeline from beginning to end for the first time .
Astron@@ omers used a worldwide network of tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es to detect the phenomenon before looking at T@@ ES@@ S , whose permanent viewing zones designed to find distant plan@@ ets , caught the beginning of the violent event .
Thomas Hol@@ o@@ ien , an astron@@ omer for the Car@@ neg@@ ie Institution for Science who led the research , said : " This was really a combination of both being good and being lucky , and sometimes that 's what you need to push the science forward . "
Stars get su@@ cked in when they venture too close to a super@@ massive black hole , which lives at the centre of most gal@@ ax@@ ies , including the Earth 's Mil@@ ky Way .
The black hole 's impressive gra@@ vit@@ ational forces tear the star apart , with some of its material thrown into space and the rest into the black hole , forming a dis@@ c of hot , bright gas as it is s@@ wal@@ lowed .
Mr Hol@@ o@@ ien added : " Spec@@ ific@@ ally , we are able to measure the rate at which it gets bri@@ ghter after it starts bri@@ ghtening , and we also observed a drop in its temperature and bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness that is unique . "
UK business committee to probe Thomas Cook collapse
The UK 's Civil Aviation Authority said today that 72 flights are scheduled to operate to bring back a further 16@@ ,000 people to the country following the collapse of travel group Thomas Cook .
The aviation regulator said it has brought back over 40 % of the total number of passengers in the largest pe@@ ace@@ time re@@ patri@@ ation ' Operation Mat@@ ter@@ horn ' launched on Monday .
Meanwhile , the British parliament 's business committee has launched an inquiry into the collapse of Thomas Cook and will seek to question the management over issues such as executive pay and accounting practices .
Thomas Cook , the world 's oldest tour operator , collapsed in the early hours of Monday , hitting hotel owners , tourist sites and res@@ orts around the world .
" The main players in the sad dem@@ ise of Britain 's oldest travel firm should face public scrutiny and be held to account for their actions before the company collapsed , " said Rachel Reeves , Chair of the Business , Energy and Industrial Strateg@@ y ( BE@@ IS ) Committee .
E@@ vi@@ dence hearings will begin in mid-@@ to-@@ late October .
" Direc@@ tors will welcome the opportunity to set the record straight and demonstrate that their conduct was always in the best interests of Thomas Cook 's customers , employees and stakeholders , " a person familiar with the company told Reuters .
Why The Times Publ@@ ished Details of the Wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ B@@ lower 's Ident@@ ity
On Thursday , The Times published exclusive details about the identity of the wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ b@@ lower whose claims led Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry against President Trump this week . ( The article reported that the wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ b@@ lower is a C.@@ I@@ .A. officer who was previously detailed to work at the White House and had expertise on Ukraine . )
Many readers , including some who work in national security and intelligence , have criticized The Times 's decision to publish the details , saying it potentially put the person 's life in danger and may have a ch@@ illing effect on w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ blo@@ wers .
We took their concerns to Dean Ba@@ quet , The Times 's executive editor , who responded to them in a discussion with the Re@@ ader Center :
The president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ b@@ lower , who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proce@@ eding . The president himself has called the wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ b@@ lower 's account a " political h@@ ack job . "
We decided to publish limited information about the wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ b@@ lower - including the fact that he works for a non@@ political agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House - because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judg@@ ments about whether or not he is credible .
China Says It Di@@ d@@ n 't Fight Any War Nor Inv@@ aded Foreign Land
China on Friday said it has not prov@@ oked a " single war or conflict " or " inv@@ aded a single square " of foreign land , sk@@ ir@@ ting any reference to the 1962 war with India .
" China has always been dedicated to resol@@ ving territ@@ orial and mar@@ itime del@@ im@@ itation disputes through negoti@@ ation and consultation , " stated an official white paper released , four days ahead of the country set to celebrate its 70@@ th anniversary of the leadership of the ruling Communist Party of China ( C@@ PC ) on October 1 .
" China safe@@ guards world peace through real actions . Over the past 70 years , China has not prov@@ oked a single war or conflict , nor inv@@ aded a single square of foreign land , " the paper titled " China and the World in the New Er@@ a " said .
The white paper , while highligh@@ ting the C@@ PS 's " peaceful rise " made no reference of the bloody 1962 war with India and the vast tr@@ acts of land , especially in the Ak@@ sa@@ i Ch@@ in area , occupied by China .
The Sin@@ o-@@ India border dispute involving 3,@@ 48@@ 8-@@ k@@ m-@@ long Line of Ac@@ tual Control ( LA@@ C ) remained un@@ resolved . China also claims Ar@@ un@@ ach@@ al Pradesh as part of South Ti@@ bet , which India con@@ tests .
So far , the two countries held 21 rounds of Special Representatives talks to resolve the border dispute .
Besides the 1962 war , India and China had a major military stand@@ off at Do@@ kl@@ am in 2017 when the People 's Liber@@ ation Army ( P@@ LA ) tried to lay a road close to India " s narrow Chic@@ ken N@@ eck cor@@ ridor connecting with the Nor@@ th-@@ Eastern states in an area also claimed by Bh@@ ut@@ an .
It was finally diplom@@ atically resolved after which both sides pulled back their troops .
China also had a major military conflict with Vietnam in 1979 . China claims sovereignty over all of South China Sea . Vietnam , Malaysia , the Philippines , Brun@@ ei and Taiwan have counter claims .
" China has achieved full resolution of land border del@@ im@@ itation problems with 12 of its 14 neighbouring countries , and del@@ ine@@ ated the China-@@ Vietnam mar@@ itime bound@@ ary in the Bei@@ bu Gulf , " the white paper said , noting that since reform and opening up in 1978 , the country has cut its armed forces " by over four million . "
The two-@@ million strong Chinese military still remain the world 's largest .
Pro@@ long@@ ed mon@@ soon brings floods and chaos to many parts of India
India 's mon@@ soon season has over@@ run by almost a month , with unprecedented rainfall causing deaths from collap@@ sing buildings and many crops beginning to rot .
Norm@@ ally the mon@@ soon in north India rec@@ e@@ des by the beginning of September , but the average rainfall this month has been 37 % above normal . If the situation continues for the remaining few days , it will be the latest the mon@@ soon has ever rec@@ e@@ ded in decades , according to experts in the India Meteor@@ ological Department .
Many areas of the country are still getting unprecedented rain , the latest being the town of Pun@@ e in western India , where tor@@ r@@ ential rain on Wednesday and Thursday caused several deaths and ha@@ vo@@ c from collapsed buildings .
Hom@@ es were flooded and people w@@ aded through streets with water up to their kne@@ es in scenes normally seen only at the height of the mon@@ soon .
Other cities such as Kolkata , Luck@@ now and Hyderabad have also experienced heavy rainfall . Utt@@ ar@@ ak@@ hand state in the north has seen extensive damage to homes from the prolonged ra@@ ins .
The mon@@ soon was also late to arrive . Many areas suffered water shortages and farmers br@@ aced themselves for a possible drought .
The extended mon@@ soon is not welcome among farmers . " This amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year . It is making my vegetables - I 've got cab@@ bage , beans , pe@@ as and tom@@ atoes at the moment - rot , " said Pra@@ k@@ ash Mehr@@ a , a small farmer in B@@ him@@ tal in Utt@@ ar@@ ak@@ hand .
For consumers , the impact of the delayed and now late-@@ rec@@ eding mon@@ soon has meant a rise in the price in the price of on@@ ions , an essential ingredi@@ ent in Indian food . On@@ ions are selling at 80 ru@@ pe@@ es ( about £ 1 ) a kil@@ o in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai , as opposed to the normal 20 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 23@@ p ) .
Festivals are also at risk . The next big festival is D@@ us@@ se@@ hra on 8 October , when H@@ ind@@ us er@@ ect giant , comic boo@@ k-@@ style eff@@ ig@@ ies of Rav@@ ana , a figure from the Hindu epic The Ram@@ ay@@ ana who sports a bush@@ y mou@@ st@@ ache and an evil gr@@ in .
Bur@@ ning Rav@@ ana symbol@@ ises the triumph of good over evil . But given that the eff@@ ig@@ ies are made of paper , if the mon@@ soon continues , Rav@@ ana might have the last laugh .
Julian Assange : Private security firm ' sp@@ ied on WikiLe@@ aks founder in Ecu@@ ador@@ ian embassy for CI@@ A@@ '
A Spanish private security company hired to protect the Ecu@@ ador@@ ian embassy in London when Julian Assange lived there sp@@ ied on the WikiLe@@ aks founder for the US intelligence service , it has been claimed .
A report in Spanish newspaper El Pa@@ is said the company , UC Global S@@ L , allegedly handed over audio and video to the CIA of meetings Assange held with his lawyers .
The company is being investigated over the claims by Spain 's High Court , the Au@@ dien@@ cia N@@ ac@@ ional , said the report .
Assange filed a criminal complaint himself , in which he accused the company of violating his privacy and the sec@@ rec@@ y of his cli@@ ent-@@ attorney privileg@@ es .
El Pa@@ is said UC Global S@@ L had failed to respond to requests for comment on the claims .
In April , Assange was dragged out of the embassy after being handed over to the British authorities by Ecu@@ ador .
He took refu@@ ge there in 2012 while on bail and facing extradition to Sweden over sex assault allegations , saying he feared extradition to the US if he left over the activities of WikiLe@@ aks .
The US formally requested his extradition in June on 18 charges , including computer mis@@ use and the un@@ author@@ ised disclosure of national defence information .
He is accused of working with former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning .
He is now in Bel@@ mar@@ sh prison in London after being jailed for violating bail conditions imposed over the Swedish extradition request and was due to be released last week , but was re@@ mand@@ ed in custody pending a hearing of the US extradition case in London in February 2020 .
In May , Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation into an allegation of rape against Assange - an allegation he has always denied .

Why we still need Gandhi
The leaders of the world 's two largest democr@@ acies need to heed the principles of a remarkable man whose 150@@ th birthday we are currently celebrating .
Moh@@ an@@ das Kar@@ am@@ ch@@ and " Mah@@ at@@ ma " Gandhi , who was born on Oct. 2 , 18@@ 69 , left a worldwide legacy with his focus on eth@@ ics , non@@ violence , tolerance and social justice . He had a profound impact on two of the most important mass mobili@@ z@@ ations in the United States .
The influence of Gandhi on the civil rights movement actually started well before the Re@@ v. Martin Luther King 's embrace of his ide@@ als , with African-@@ American activists such as Howard Thur@@ man and Benjamin Mays under@@ taking long sea vo@@ y@@ ages to India to meet Gandhi .
And C@@ es@@ ar Cha@@ vez , who model@@ ed many of his tactics on Gandhi 's in leading the far@@ m@@ workers " movement , tr@@ aced his political aw@@ ak@@ ening to a news@@ re@@ el he watched at the age of 11 or 12 showing that " this half-@@ naked man without a gun had con@@ qu@@ ered the might of the British Empire . "
Outside the United States , Gandhi had a similar effect . Nelson Mand@@ ela , the Dal@@ ai L@@ ama , Nobel Peace Pri@@ z@@ e-@@ winner Mal@@ ala You@@ saf@@ z@@ ai and climate change activists , to give just a few examples , have acknowledged Gandhi as a gu@@ iding light .
But President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who triumph@@ antly addressed a joint me@@ ga-@@ rally in Houston recently , seem to be imper@@ vious to Gandhi 's ideas , despite paying lip service to him at the event . Both are right-wing populi@@ sts who have ruled with sc@@ ant comp@@ as@@ sion or tolerance , successfully mobili@@ zing wh@@ ites and H@@ ind@@ us in their respective countries as voting b@@ loc@@ s , and f@@ om@@ enting division and social ant@@ agon@@ ism .
Modi has belong@@ ed , since he was 8 years old , to a Hindu nationalist organization known as the R@@ SS , an ex-@@ member of which , N@@ ath@@ ur@@ am God@@ se , assass@@ inated Gandhi on Jan. 30 , 19@@ 48 . Indeed , par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ari@@ ans from Modi 's ruling Bhar@@ ati@@ ya Jan@@ ata Party have he@@ ap@@ ed praise on Gandhi 's killer in recent years .
The Modi government 's un-@@ Gand@@ h@@ ian approach has manifest@@ ed itself on many fron@@ ts . It has stripped the Mus@@ lim@@ -@@ majority province of Jammu and Kashmir of its auton@@ omy and state@@ hood and put it into lockdown . It has proven un@@ welcoming to the mostly Muslim Rohing@@ ya refugees who have fled from extreme per@@ sec@@ ution in Myanmar .
And Modi 's government has created an u@@ pro@@ ar by inst@@ it@@ uting a national regist@@ ry of citizens and setting up detention camps in the border state of Assam to o@@ sten@@ sibly catch non@@ citizens from neighboring Mus@@ lim@@ -@@ majority Bangladesh , a step that may end up dis@@ en@@ franch@@ ising and impris@@ oning almost 2 million people .
Trump is singing from a similar song@@ book . His administration 's Mus@@ lim@@ -@@ majority travel ban echo@@ es the Islam@@ opho@@ bia that often inform@@ s Modi 's policy@@ making . Its call@@ ousness toward refugees mir@@ rors the Indian government 's dis@@ da@@ in for the Rohing@@ ya population 's suffering , and its detention camps parallel the ones the Modi regime is setting up . Trump 's stir@@ ring of racial anim@@ osity is an@@ alog@@ ous to tro@@ ubl@@ esome rhetoric from a number of Modi 's cabinet members .
There was a te@@ ach@@ able moment for the two leaders at their recent joint rally . House Majority Leader St@@ en@@ y Ho@@ yer at the event quoted Gandhi 's definition of democracy as " something that gives the weak the same chance as the strong . "
Trump and Modi would do very well to keep Gandhi 's advice in mind , 150 years after his birth .
Trump nomin@@ ates Peter Gay@@ nor to be FE@@ MA chief : White House
Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FE@@ MA ) Ac@@ ting Administ@@ rator Peter Gay@@ nor s@@ miles as he test@@ i@@ fies before a Senate Ap@@ propri@@ ations Homeland Security Sub@@ committee hearing on FE@@ MA 's F@@ Y@@ 2020 budget request on Capitol Hill in Washington , U.S. , April 3 , 2019 .
U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gay@@ nor on Thursday to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FE@@ MA ) , the White House said in a statement .
Gay@@ nor , FE@@ MA 's deputy administ@@ rator , had been acting chief of the agency , which over@@ sees the government response to dis@@ asters like hurri@@ canes and wildfires .
The agency has been without a Sen@@ ate-@@ confirmed administ@@ rator since March , when Bro@@ ck Long left the post . Long resigned after the Department of Homeland Security , under which FE@@ MA falls , concluded Long had in@@ appropri@@ ately used government vehicles to commu@@ te between Washington and his home in North Carolina .
A different nominee for the job , Jeffrey B@@ yard , was withdrawn from consideration earlier this month , after a background check un@@ covered allegations that he had been involved in a bar@@ room bra@@ wl .
Gay@@ nor 's nomination to the post was expected . He will require a majority of the Senate to approve the nomination to take the job .
Before becoming FE@@ MA 's deputy administ@@ rator in 2018 , Gay@@ nor worked in emergency management in Rhode Island and was a Marine , the White House said .
Man set al@@ ight on door@@ step ' in targeted attack@@ '
A man has been set al@@ ight on his door@@ step in what police believe is a targeted attack .
The 48@@ -year-old was so@@ aked in fl@@ amm@@ able liquid , believed to be petrol , before bur@@ sting into flames outside his home in Sk@@ el@@ mer@@ s@@ dale , West Lancashire .
He is in hospital in a critical but stable condition after suffering serious burns .
Police have launched an attempted murder inquiry after they were called to the man 's house at about 1@@ am on Thursday .
Detective Chief Inspector Pau@@ line St@@ ables , leading the investigation , said : " This is a horrific incident which has left a man in a very poorly condition in hospital .
" We are carrying out a number of en@@ quiries to try to identify those responsible .
" While we are trying to establish a mo@@ tive for what has happened , we do believe that the incident was targeted and I would like to stress that I don 't believe there is any threat to the wider community at this time .
" Someone out there knows who has done this and I would urge them to come forward and speak to us .
" Has a loved one come home acting susp@@ ici@@ ously , sm@@ elling of smoke or petrol or with un@@ explained injuries ?
" We need to find the people responsible for this dre@@ ad@@ ful crime . "
Vul@@ ner@@ able Dems air impeachment concerns to Pelosi
During the meeting , several members made clear their stance that Democrats should keep the inquiry focused on the Ukraine matter -- allegations that Trump asked the Ukrainian President to initi@@ ate an investigation into a potential 2020 political rival -- and not the other instances of potential wrongdoing detailed in the report from special counsel Robert Mueller .
Democrats are largely in agreement about the strategy , with Pelosi saying during her press conference on Thursday morning that the whistleblower complaint is " the focus of the moment . "
By keeping the impeachment inquiry focused , leaders hope to keep the caucus uni@@ fied -- with an eye to the moderate members who only recently joined calls for proceedings . The Ukraine matter is also relatively cle@@ ar-@@ cut and easy to explain to the public , lawmakers say . They also argue the probe , sp@@ ear@@ headed by the intelligence committee , will be able to move faster -- possibly in the next month or two -- with a nar@@ ro@@ wer scope .
Rep. Ang@@ ie Craig , a vulnerable freshman Democrat from Minnesota , who said earlier this week that she supported the impeachment inquiry said after the meeting that Pelosi and Democratic leaders mostly listened to the views raised by the lawmakers .
" I 'm in a district where I 've been reluctant to move forward only from the perspective where I want to be discipl@@ ined , I want to look at due process and want to make sure we get all of our facts -- and this process will allow us to do that , " Craig said , adding she backed a narrow probe led by the House Intelligence Committee .
Rep. Matt Car@@ tw@@ right , a Democrat from Pennsylvania , told CNN that he wouldn 't -- at this point -- vote for articles of impeachment .
" I would vote no right now because we haven 't seen all the facts , " Car@@ tw@@ right said . " We have to pre@@ su@@ me that people are innocent , don 't we , and we have to see if what the press has been reporting and what has been revealed in terms of docum@@ entation , if if all that is true . "
Democrats will hear from constitu@@ ents about their moves toward impeachment soon , with members scheduled to return to their districts for a two-@@ week rec@@ ess at the start of October . It will be the first time a sw@@ ath of members from more conservative districts will receive clear , in-person feedback -- or , in some cases , b@@ low@@ back -- from the people they represent since they joined calls for impeachment proceedings in the wake of the Ukraine allegations earlier this week .
But Rep. Dan Kil@@ dee , a Michigan Democrat , said the timing of the rec@@ ess has its up@@ sides .
" I really can 't think of a better thing to do than to sort of check in with the boss before we move forward , " he told reporters . " It 's actually good timing that we get a chance to go home , catch our breath , get the perspective of people back home , explain what we 're doing , and then come back and move forward accor@@ ding@@ ly . "
Once lawmakers return , though , movement is likely to be quick .
" I think it 's everybody 's intention here to get this done in 2019 , " said Rep. Jamie Ras@@ kin , an impeachment advocate and member of the Judiciary Committee .
" The caucus is uni@@ fied around the law@@ less@@ ness and corruption pouring forth from the White House , and our job will be to reduce it to a set of articles of impeachment that make sense to the country , " the Maryland Democrat told reporters on Thursday night . " We need a set of articles that make a compelling legal case and that tell a co@@ her@@ ent story to the public . And if we do our job right , it will be a un@@ ifying exercise for the whole country . "
Rep. Anthony Br@@ in@@ dis@@ i , a freshman from New York who has resi@@ sted calls for an impeachment probe , told CNN that he 's " not yet " there on impe@@ aching Trump .
" While I find many of the statements in the whistleblower 's report disturbing , there 's a lot more information that 's out there , " Br@@ in@@ dis@@ i said . " We have to talk to some of these officials that they have listed in the report here and see where it goes . "
More than half the members of the US House of Representatives have said they support an impeachment inquiry , according to a CNN count . However , that count includes many Democrats who say they support an impeachment investigation but are still waiting for the results of the probe before deciding whether to finally vote to impe@@ ach Trump . Even if the House could pass the vote , it likely would go nowhere in the Republi@@ can-@@ controlled Senate , one of many reasons the issue has been politically divisive in the party .
Still there has been a surge in support -- more than 75 House members in about three days -- of launching such an inquiry as part of the fallout from Trump 's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Vol@@ o@@ dymyr Zelensky where he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden . There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden .
Trump official says lawyers had Ukraine call tran@@ script moved to secure system
A senior Trump administration official acknowledged Friday that White House lawyers directed moving the tran@@ script of President Trump 's July phone call with Ukrainian President Vol@@ o@@ dymyr Zelensky to a highly secure system .
Other details about what efforts were taken to move the records are not immediately known , beyond the allegations contained in the whistleblower complaint about that call .
The whistleblower complaint , which was dec@@ las@@ si@@ fied by the Trump administration and released to the public on Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee , alleg@@ es that White House officials said they were " directed " by White House attorneys to remove the tran@@ script of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept .
The whistleblower alleged that the tran@@ script was kept on a different system normally used for classified information . The whistleblower also said that , according to White House officials , it was " not the first time " a presidential tran@@ script was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national secur@@ ity-@@ sensitive information . The complaint alleged that the White House tried to " restrict access " to records of the call .
" In the days following the phone call , I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had interven@@ ed to " lock down " all records of the phone call , especially the official wor@@ d-@@ for-@@ word tran@@ script of the call that was produced - as custom@@ ary - by the White House Situation Room , " the whistleblower stated .
The White House released an unc@@ las@@ si@@ fied version of that tran@@ script of the call on Wednesday . The memo , which does not reflect a " verb@@ ati@@ m tran@@ script " but is based on " notes and rec@@ olle@@ ctions " of those mem@@ ori@@ alizing the call , shows Trump seeking assistance in investigating the Bidens .
" The other thing , there is a lot of talk about Biden 's son , that Biden stopped prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great , " he said . " Biden went around br@@ ag@@ ging that he stopped the prosecution , so if you can look into it ... sounds horrible to me . "
This ref@@ ers to Joe Biden , while vice president , urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor Vik@@ tor Sho@@ kin who was investigating the natural gas firm Bur@@ isma Holdings - where his son , Hunter Biden , was on the board . Biden allies maintain that corruption concerns prompted his intervention .
But the whistleblower 's complaint alleg@@ es that Trump was solic@@ iting foreign assistance to help in the 2020 campaign . The whistleblower acknowledged in the complaint , though , that the concerns were based on second-@@ hand information .
The White House lawyers " direc@@ tive to move the tran@@ script has been character@@ ized by top Democrats as a " cover@@ -up . "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-@@ Calif . , who was prompted by Ukraine developments this week to announce a formal impeachment inquiry into the president , called the move a " cover@@ -up " and said it would be part of the impeachment inquiry .
Meanwhile , Trump lawyer Jay Se@@ ku@@ low down@@ played the importance of the record-@@ keeping details .
" A cover@@ -up ? Think about that for a moment , " Se@@ ku@@ low said on " Fox & Friends " Friday . " The White House secured a call with the president of Ukraine ? It 's so secret and such a cover@@ -up , here 's the documents . This is non@@ sense . "
Ukraine scandal : Pelosi says Barr ' ro@@ gue ' ; former U.S. officials back investigation
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused U.S. Attorney General William Barr Friday of going " ro@@ gue " to protect President Donald Trump over his controversial phone call with Ukraine 's leader , which has led to an impeachment inquiry .
The California Democrat 's words follow a release of the complaint Thursday , which was submitted by an un@@ identified intelligence official to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael At@@ kinson . At@@ kinson turned it over to national intelligence director Joseph Maguire .
Barr is mentioned several times in the July 25 phone call , as is Trump attorney Ru@@ dol@@ ph Giuliani . The complaint says White House officials were concerned enough that they attempted to " lock down " the record of the call .
" [ Barr has ] gone ro@@ gue , " Pelosi told MSNBC Friday . " I think where they 're going is a cover@@ -up of a cover@@ -up . I think it 's sad , to have a Justice Department go so ro@@ gue . Well , they have been for a while . And now it just makes matters worse . "
Pelosi announced an official impeachment investigation this week after Trump acknowledged he 'd with@@ held military aid to Ukraine . The aid was ultimately granted , but House Democrats want to know whether there was any connection to the aid and Trump 's asking Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden , who worked for a Ukrainian gas company for five years .
Also Friday , nearly 300 former U.S. foreign policy and national security officials signed a letter supporting the impeachment investigation . The coalition said Trump 's actions const@@ itute a " profound national security concern . "
" We appl@@ aud those members of Congress , including Speaker Pelosi , who have started us down that necessary path , " the letter states . " President Trump appears to have le@@ ver@@ aged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic process . That would const@@ itute an un@@ consci@@ on@@ able abuse of power .
" It would also represent an effort to sub@@ ordin@@ ate America 's national interests -- and those of our closest allies and partners -- to the president 's personal political interest . "
Trump has denied there was any impro@@ pri@@ ety with the phone call . Friday , he deno@@ unced the complain@@ ant and again said the call with Zelensky was a " perfect conversation "
" So@@ unding more and more like the so-called wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ b@@ lower isn 't a wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ b@@ lower at all , " he tweeted . " In addition , all second-@@ hand information that proved to be so in@@ accurate that there may not have been somebody else , a le@@ aker or spy , feeding it to him or her ? A partisan operative ? "
Vice President Mike Pence also had interactions with Ukrainian leaders , the wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ b@@ lower complaint shows , and he met with Zelensky in Poland earlier this month . He said neither Joe Biden or Hunter Biden were discussed .
Death of Chinese activist in police custody promp@@ ts calls for investigation into torture
Human rights advocates are calling for an investigation into the death of a Chinese activist , arrested after holding up a plac@@ ard calling for Chinese leader Xi Jinping to step down .
Wang Mei@@ y@@ u , 38 , was detained in July after he stood outside the Hun@@ an provin@@ cial police department holding a sign that called on Xi and Chinese premier Li Ke@@ q@@ iang to resign and implement universal suff@@ rage in China . He was later charged with " picking quar@@ rels and prov@@ oking trouble , " a v@@ ague offence often given to dis@@ sidents .
According to Wang 's mother and lawyer , he died on Monday . Wang 's wife Ca@@ o Shu@@ x@@ ia received a call from police noti@@ fying her that her husband had died at a military hospital in the city of H@@ eng@@ yang where he had been held . The police officer on the phone did not offer any explanation of the cause of death .
According to Min@@ sh@@ eng Gu@@ anch@@ a , a Chinese human rights group , Ca@@ o was later able to see Wang 's body and saw he was ble@@ eding from his eyes , mouth , ears and nose and there were bru@@ ises on his face .
" The Chinese government must investigate allegations of torture and the death in detention of human rights activist Wang Mei@@ y@@ u and hold the perpet@@ rators of torture and extra@@ judicial killing crimin@@ ally accountable , " the Chinese Human Rights Defen@@ ders ( CH@@ R@@ D ) said in a statement .
According to Radio Free Asia , Ca@@ o said police pres@@ su@@ red her to accept their statement that Wang 's death had been an accident but she refused . An officer at the H@@ eng@@ yang police station said he could not comment on the case . Wang 's mother told the Guardian the family has been offered compensation of more than 2 million yu@@ an ( about $ 2@@ 20,000 ) .
" Gi@@ ving compensation without an investigation or criminal accountability for the perpet@@ rator is not true red@@ ress nor will it effectively prevent torture , " said Frances Eve , deputy director of research at CH@@ R@@ D .
" E@@ specially when a family has effectively been held ho@@ stage and thus likely co@@ er@@ ced into giving up claims for investigation for the compensation . "
Wang 's death follows after those of other activists including grass@@ roots lawyer J@@ i Si@@ zu@@ n , who died in police custody in July , U@@ igh@@ ur schol@@ ar Muhammad S@@ ali@@ h Ha@@ j@@ im who died last year . Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate winner Liu Xia@@ ob@@ o who was denied cancer treatment died in 2017 while serving an 11-@@ year-@@ prison sentence and activist Ca@@ o Sh@@ un@@ li died in 2014 , detained after attempting to attend a UN session on human rights in China .
Since Monday , Wang 's family has been placed under house arrest , according to CH@@ R@@ D . He has two young children . Others connected to his case have also come under pressure . Late on Wednesday , six armed police detained X@@ ie Yang , a rights lawyer , and Chen Yan@@ hu@@ i , an activist , who had met at a hotel to discuss Wang 's case . They were released on Thursday .
Wang , who began his work as an activist when his home was for@@ ci@@ bly demol@@ ished , has been detained and claimed to have suffered torture before .
In 2018 after he held up the plac@@ ard calling for Xi 's resignation , he wrote online of how police stor@@ med into his home , ordering him to write a conf@@ ession letter and a statement promising he would stop .
" These idi@@ ots . They can 't understand that even after these years of per@@ sec@@ ution , including being depri@@ ved of water for three days or suffering two hours of electrical need@@ les that caused me to v@@ om@@ it blood , I won 't sur@@ render . "

Hong Kong police say student arrests at protests increase
Hong Kong police said Friday that students accounted for 29 % of nearly 1,@@ 600 people detained in anti-@@ democracy protests since June and urged young people to take the " straight and narrow path " as more major rallies are planned this weekend .
Police public relations chief T@@ se Ch@@ un-@@ chung said 20@@ 7 high school and university students were detained this month alone despite the resu@@ mption of classes after the summer holiday , compared to 25@@ 7 over the Jun@@ e-@@ August period .
He said there was a rise in teenagers participating in violent crimes , with some already charged in court . This included a 16@@ -year-old charged recently with ar@@ son , which carries possible a life impris@@ onment upon conviction , a 13@@ -year-old girl charged with des@@ ec@@ rating Chinese flags and others with attacking police officers and carrying dangerous weapons .
" It is an alarming trend to us , " he said at a news conference . " It is worrying to see these you@@ ths breaking the law and possibly having criminal records at such a young and tender age . We appeal to all young@@ sters to re@@ think their actions and hope the education sector and parents will help our young people to walk the straight and narrow path . "
Young people have largely led the protests that started in June over an extradition bill that the government has now agreed to withdraw . But the movement has since drawn wider participation as it snow@@ ball@@ ed into a wider anti-@@ China campaign against what protesters say is Beijing 's cre@@ eping in@@ tru@@ sion into Hong Kong 's auton@@ omy promised when the former British col@@ ony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 .
Protesters have wi@@ dened their demands to include direct elections for the city 's leaders and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality against protesters .
Thousands of people staged a peaceful protest at a downtown square Friday night against alleged abuse of power by police , w@@ aving anti-@@ police bann@@ ers and chan@@ ting pro-@@ democracy slo@@ gans . The government has said complaints against police will be examined by a police watchdog agency that critics say is t@@ ooth@@ less and has no real investigative powers .
Police have approved a major rally in downtown Hong Kong on Saturday organized by the Civil Human Rights Front to mark the fifth anniversary of the start of the Um@@ bre@@ lla Revolution , when protesters occupied key thor@@ ough@@ fa@@ res in the city for 79 days in 2014 to demand universal suff@@ rage . That movement ended without any government conc@@ ession .
Protesters are also organiz@@ ing " anti-@@ total@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism " rallies in Hong Kong and many cities worldwide on Sunday against what they deno@@ unced as China 's ty@@ ran@@ ny .
T@@ se appealed to protesters to stop hi@@ j@@ acking peaceful protests , like what happened in previous rallies when some lob@@ bed gas@@ ol@@ ine bombs , set off street fires and vand@@ alized public util@@ ities . Police have responded with tear gas , water cann@@ ons , and other measures , prompting complaints from protesters that they are using excessive force .
The Civil Human Rights Front is also planning another big march on Oct. 1 , spar@@ king fears of a bloody show@@ down that could embar@@ r@@ ass China 's ruling Communist Party as it marks its 70@@ th year in power with grand fest@@ iv@@ ities in Beijing . The Hong Kong government has sc@@ aled down National Day celebrations by calling off an annual fire@@ work display and moving a reception indoors .
N@@ est@@ le tigh@@ tens controls on coffee beans after wee@@ d@@ killer sc@@ are
The world 's largest coffee company said in a statement Friday that it had found gl@@ yp@@ ho@@ s@@ ate resi@@ du@@ es close to the maximum allowed in some deliveries of green coffee beans .
Gl@@ yp@@ ho@@ s@@ ate is the key ingredi@@ ent in Mon@@ san@@ to 's wee@@ d@@ killer , Ro@@ un@@ dup . In the United States , j@@ uries have awarded huge monetary damages to people who say their cancer was caused by exposure to gl@@ yp@@ ho@@ s@@ ate . Bay@@ er , which owns Mon@@ san@@ to , says the her@@ b@@ icide is safe when used properly , as does the US Environmental Protection Agency .
Ne@@ um@@ ann Kaffee Gruppe ( N@@ K@@ G ) , one of the world 's largest traders , said gl@@ yp@@ ho@@ s@@ ate was one of a number of subst@@ ances it monit@@ ored on the coffee it bu@@ ys . N@@ est@@ le bu@@ ys some of its coffee beans from N@@ K@@ G . It was too early to say what consequences N@@ est@@ le 's ti@@ ghter controls would have on N@@ K@@ G , a spokesperson said .
N@@ est@@ le 's ( NS@@ R@@ G@@ F ) decision to increase the frequ@@ ency of checks was unlikely to dis@@ rupt global coffee supply chains , a spokesperson said . " This is not a new process , we are just rein@@ forcing controls , " the spokesperson told CNN Business . Tests were done before the coffee was shi@@ pped from the countries of origin .
N@@ est@@ le would start with suppliers in Indonesia and Brazil , since these countries are among the world 's biggest coffee producers .
" Our ag@@ ron@@ om@@ ists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve their we@@ ed management practices , including the appropriate use of her@@ b@@ icides and adoption of other wee@@ ding methods , " the Swiss company said .
Brands such as N@@ es@@ cafe and N@@ es@@ pres@@ so make up a si@@ z@@ able ch@@ unk of N@@ est@@ le 's pow@@ dered and liquid be@@ ver@@ ages business , which generated sales of 21.@@ 6 billion Swiss fran@@ cs ( $ 21.@@ 7 billion ) in 2018 . N@@ est@@ le last year agreed a deal to sell Starbucks ' pack@@ aged coff@@ ees and te@@ as around the world .
Does gl@@ yp@@ ho@@ s@@ ate cause cancer ?
Gl@@ yp@@ ho@@ s@@ ate is used on more than 100 food crops , according to the EPA . Scientists at an environmental advocacy group with links to the organic food industry say several popular breakfast cer@@ e@@ als contain doses of the chemical that are higher than they consider safe for children .
Still , the EPA says gl@@ yp@@ ho@@ s@@ ate is not a car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen and that it poses no public health risks . Ec@@ ological risks include damage to poll@@ in@@ ators and the problem of we@@ ed resistance , the EPA said in a statement in April .
But that has not stopped thousands of people from filing lawsuits against Mon@@ san@@ to alleg@@ ing that exposure to Ro@@ un@@ dup caused them or their loved ones to develop cancer .
Earlier this year , a jury ordered Bay@@ er to pay a California couple $ 2 billion in damages after they claimed that Ro@@ un@@ dup , used on their property for more than three decades , had given them both Non-@@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin lymp@@ hom@@ a within four years of one other . Bay@@ er is con@@ testing the verdict .
A 2015 study by the World Health Organization 's International Agency for Research on Cancer found that gl@@ yp@@ ho@@ s@@ ate was " probably car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic to humans , " based on " limited " evidence of cancer in humans and " sufficient " evidence of cancer in experimental animals . However , a joint panel of the WHO and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization later concluded that gl@@ yp@@ ho@@ s@@ ate is unlikely to pose a car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic risk to humans from exposure through diet .
Man guilty of killing 6 members of his extended family in Texas
A Utah man was convicted Thursday of killing six members of his extended family in Texas and faces the possibility of a death sentence .
A Harris County jury found Ronald Has@@ k@@ ell , 39 , guilty in the July 2014 killings of six members of the Stay family : parents Stephen Stay and Katie Stay , and children Bryan , 13 , Emily , 9 , Rebecca , 7 and Z@@ ach , 4 .
" We are grateful for the jur@@ ors ' rap@@ t attention over the last many weeks to every piece of evidence in the case , " Harris County District Attorney Kim O@@ g@@ g said in a statement . " There was never a reasonable doubt that Has@@ k@@ ell me@@ ticul@@ ously planned and carried out the slaughter of the Stay family . "
Police have said that Has@@ k@@ ell traveled from California to the Houston suburb of Spring and am@@ bush@@ ed his ex-@@ wife 's sister , her husband and their five children in their home .
The St@@ ays and four of their children were fat@@ ally shot in the back of their heads , and a fifth child , who was 15 at the time , survived . That teen , C@@ assi@@ dy , was gra@@ zed in the head by a bullet and played dead .
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in the capital murder case , but jur@@ ors will decide whether Has@@ k@@ ell should receive a death sentence or life in prison .
At trial , the defense argued that Has@@ k@@ ell was ins@@ ane and heard voices that led him to kill the six people , NBC affili@@ ate K@@ PR@@ C of Houston reported . After the verdict was read Thursday , he hung his head .
" I think he took it as best as you could expect , " said Doug Durham , one of Has@@ k@@ ell 's defense attorneys , according to the station . " He was aware that this was a strong possibility . "
The sentencing phase begins Monday . Has@@ k@@ ell defense attorney Neil Davis III said his team will work " to save his life . That 's our job , " according to K@@ PR@@ C .
The sentencing phase is expected to last around 2 ½ weeks , the station reported .
C@@ assi@@ dy testified at the trial and was surrounded by family members . She appeared to be pra@@ ying before the guilty verdict was read Thursday , according to K@@ PR@@ C .
At a 2014 memorial for her family , C@@ assi@@ dy thanked the community for its support and said that she was com@@ for@@ ted knowing her parents , two brothers and two sisters are " in a much better place , and that I 'll be able to see them again one day . "
Has@@ k@@ ell was disgu@@ ised as a Fed@@ Ex delivery driver when he went to the Stay home , apparently looking for his ex-@@ wife , who is Katie Stay 's sister .
He forced his way inside and tied up C@@ assi@@ dy , officials said . When the rest of her family returned minutes later , Has@@ k@@ ell tied them up and demanded to know the where@@ ab@@ outs of his ex-@@ wife . They said they didn 't know , and they were each shot in the back of the head .
C@@ assi@@ dy , who was wounded , played dead until Has@@ k@@ ell left , and was able to identify him to police . She told officials he was planning to drive to her grand@@ parents ' home and kill them . But police tracked down Has@@ k@@ ell , and he was arrested after a 20-@@ minute police chase and a three-@@ hour stand@@ off .
US deaths could result in Scottish ban on v@@ aping and e-@@ cigare@@ tte ads
A B@@ AN on advertising for e-@@ cigarettes and v@@ aping products , is being considered by ministers .
The First Minister has confirmed that a consultation on the move would take place in " the coming months . "
Nicola Sturgeon says that if evidence supports further moves over the sale of such products her Government would " not hes@@ itate " to act .
It comes as it emerged a v@@ ap@@ ing-@@ related illness had claimed two more lives , bringing the total number of fatalities to 11 .
V@@ aping - which involves in@@ hal@@ ing a mix typically made of nic@@ ot@@ ine , water , sol@@ v@@ ents and fl@@ avo@@ urs - is seen as an alternative to smoking which can help you quit , but its safety is still not entirely known .
But in the US , more than 500 people are known to have fallen ill with a mysterious lung disease after smoking e-@@ cigarettes . Officials said hundreds of additional cases had been reported in the past week alone .
The first deaths in Florida and Georgia were announced on Tuesday and Wednesday . Currently 38 states have recorded cases of the illness , with lives lost in eight states .
While most patients have reported a history of using products containing TH@@ C , the psy@@ cho@@ active compound in cannabis , the patient who died in Georgia on Wednesday reported only " heavy nic@@ ot@@ ine v@@ aping . "
The Cent@@ res for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has more than 100 officials investigating the cause of the mystery illness , and has warned citizens against smoking e-@@ cigare@@ tte products until more is known , particularly if modi@@ fied or bought " off the street . "
The First Minister has confirmed the Scottish Government was monit@@ origin developments in the US and elsewhere " closely , " following the loss of life that has been attributed to v@@ aping .
She pointed out that to date they have not seen any cases of deaths attributed to v@@ aping being reported in Europe .
" Our approach has been a precau@@ tionary one , which is why in Scotland we have already taken the stric@@ test regulatory approach in Europe to v@@ ap@@ our products , " she said .
" The European tobacco products direc@@ tive restric@@ ts the advertising of e-@@ cigarettes and ensu@@ res that e-@@ li@@ qui@@ ds cannot contain ingredients that are known to be harmful .
" The direc@@ tive also limits the concentration of nic@@ ot@@ ine in e-@@ li@@ qui@@ ds .
" In Scotland , we have also introduced a retail register and a mandatory age ver@@ ification scheme and we have funded trading standards departments in all council areas to ensure that retailers comply with the regulations .
" In the coming months , we will consu@@ lt on introducing a complete ban on the advertising and promotion of v@@ ap@@ our products . "
She added : " It is important to stress , and for all of us to remember , that those devices are relatively new and , therefore , their impact continues to be studied . We do not yet fully understand what that impact is , which is why the approach that we have taken has been very cautious .
" That is perhaps a reason why e-@@ cigare@@ tte use remains relatively low in Scotland .
" We remain committed to following the best evidence to take any steps necessary to ensure that people are protected from potential harm .
" While we already have among the stric@@ test reg@@ imes on those products , if the evidence shows that further action is needed ... we will not hes@@ itate to take it . "
Cam@@ bo@@ dian court charges ex@@ iled politicians with re@@ bellion
A Cam@@ bo@@ dian court has charged seven top opposition politicians with p@@ lot@@ ting armed re@@ bellion for planning to return from self-@@ imposed ex@@ ile to seek a change in government through mass peaceful protests .
The Ph@@ no@@ m Pen@@ h Mun@@ ici@@ pal Court also warned that anyone who supported the plans of the Cam@@ bo@@ dia National Rescue Party to ou@@ st the government would also be ris@@ king a long prison term .
The returning party chiefs could be sent to prison for 15 to 30 years if found guilty , and their supporters could be sentenced to five to 10 years . Even attending a rally or expressing support online could be considered p@@ lot@@ ting to t@@ opp@@ le the government , Justice Ministry spokesman Ch@@ in Mal@@ in was quoted as saying .
The court 's charges on Thursday are the latest sal@@ vo in a political battle that has heated up since opposition leader Sam Rain@@ sy announced plans to return from more than three years of ex@@ ile on Nov. 9 to seek a " restor@@ ation of democracy . "
Nov. 9 is Cam@@ bo@@ dia 's independence day , celebrating when it obtained its freedom from France in 19@@ 53 .
" My calls to the people and the armed forces of # Cam@@ bo@@ dia to rise up against the regime will continue until the regime has restored to the opposition its right to participate in the country 's political life including genuine elections , " Sam Rain@@ sy said on Twitter earlier this week .
His opposition party was dis@@ solved by the courts ahead of last year 's general election , ensuring that an increasingly author@@ itarian Prime Minister H@@ un S@@ en continued his four decades in power .
The party had been expected to mount a strong challenge in the July 2018 election , and its dis@@ solution was widely seen as being politically motivated , with H@@ un S@@ en 's ruling Cam@@ bo@@ dian People 's Party fear@@ ful that it could lose power in the polls .
H@@ un S@@ en 's government seems un@@ ner@@ ved by the planned return of opposition politicians , though the effort appears to be a qui@@ x@@ otic one , with Sam Rain@@ sy calling on Cam@@ bo@@ dian workers in Thailand to ac@@ company him home in massive numbers .
Officials have vowed to arrest Sam Rain@@ sy on his arrival , but there is speculation that Cam@@ bo@@ dia may simply bar him from entry , which could even keep him from boarding a plane to the country if airlines are officially informed of such a ban . Neigh@@ bor@@ ing countries are also unlikely to allow him to enter from their territory .
However , the government has stepped up arrests of his supporters and there are reports of recent physical attacks on opposition organizers .
Sam Rain@@ sy went into ex@@ ile in late 2015 to avoid a two-year prison sentence on charges of criminal de@@ fam@@ ation . Other legal cases have since been lo@@ dged against him by the government .
Other top party members fled into ex@@ ile during a late 2017 crackdown on all opposition to H@@ un S@@ en , which included the arrest of the party 's co-founder , K@@ em S@@ ok@@ ha . He was charged with tre@@ ason , based on his links to a U.S. pro-@@ democracy organization , and is under strict house arrest .

She added : " I think it 's a broader idea of blocking the view , the out@@ ward-@@ looking view , to anywhere really . And that gesture of blocking the light .

Man ple@@ ads guilty in kidn@@ ap , torture plot of plastic sur@@ geon
A Florida man has pleaded guilty to kidn@@ apping a plastic sur@@ geon who was tor@@ tured with a b@@ low@@ tor@@ ch in an ex@@ tor@@ tion attempt .

Bo@@ c@@ cio 's attorney , Kenneth L@@ ange , said his client was convinced to take part in the scheme by co-@@ defendant , Ser@@ ge N@@ kor@@ ina , who 's being extra@@ d@@ ited from Ten@@ eri@@ fe , Spain .
Court documents say the sur@@ geon was leaving a Walmart store when he was confronted by an armed man and sho@@ ved into a van . They say he was tor@@ tured for hours before being returned to his car while un@@ conscious . Sur@@ veillance video supports the chain of events .

US sends troops , air defense systems to Saudi Arabia to deter Iran attacks
The U.S. is sending a Patri@@ ot missile battery , four ground@@ -based radar systems , and 200 support troops to Saudi Arabia to deter Iran 's increasingly aggressive behavior , officials announced Thursday .
A TH@@ A@@ AD missile defense system and two additional Patri@@ ot missile batteries are prepared to go if needed , the Pentagon said .
" Other countries have called out Iranian mis@@ advent@@ ures in the region , and we look for them to contribute assets in an international effort to rein@@ force Saudi Arabia 's defense , " Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoff@@ man said .
Last week , Defense Secretary Mark Esper said more troops would deploy to the Middle East as a " defensive " measure to help protect against attacks from Iran .
Esper said the deployment was a first step toward addressing Iran 's increasingly violent acts in the region -- including this month 's drone attack on Saudi Arab@@ ian oil facilities -- and he called on other nations to step up and condem@@ n the attacks .
Iran@@ -@@ backed Hou@@ thi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the Sept . 14 attack on the world 's largest oil processing plant and a major oil field , but the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed Iran directly . Iran has denied involvement in the attack .
" It is clear [ ... ] that the weapons used were Iran@@ i@@ an-@@ produced and were not launched from Yemen , " Esper said Friday , noting that all signs indicate " Iran was responsible for the attack . "
The purpose of deplo@@ ying troops and resources is to " send a clear message that the United States supports our partners " and provide a " free flow of resources , " Esper said .
The U.S. calls on other countries to also " stand up and condem@@ n the attacks , " as well as contribute capabilities , the secretary said .
Meghan Markle was ' never asked ' about Su@@ its c@@ ame@@ o
The creator of Su@@ its , Aaron Kor@@ sh , has said he " never asked " Britain 's Duchess of Sussex , Meghan Markle , to re@@ prise her role as Rachel Z@@ ane for a c@@ ame@@ o in the show 's last-@@ ever episode .
In an interview with Dead@@ line@@ .com following the air@@ ing of Su@@ its ' finale in the US , Kor@@ sh was asked if there was " any possibility " of the former actress being asked " to do even a small c@@ ame@@ o . "
" Now that we already did it , I will tell you , " Kor@@ sh replied .
" I thought about asking , and I thought about even using audio footage - that we have to come up with something - and in the end I didn 't ask , and I just thought , ' I 'm going to respect her new life and not put her in the position of having to ask ' .
" We decided not to put her in that position so I never asked . "
The Duchess of Sussex appeared in arch@@ ive Su@@ its footage during the finale 's mon@@ tage .
She starred as Rachel Z@@ ane in the New Yor@@ k-@@ set legal drama from 2011 until her final episode aired last year .
In the final series , Rachel 's on@@ screen husband Mike Ross , played by Patrick J Adams , paid a visit from Seattle and was asked how Rachel was getting on .
" If I told you how good , you probably wouldn 't believe me , " he replied .

Germany reports landmark case of West N@@ ile virus
Authorities are reporting the first known human case of West N@@ ile virus trans@@ mitted by mosqu@@ it@@ oes in Germany , a development apparently ha@@ st@@ ened by climate change .
The national disease control and tropical medicine centers said Friday the person developed enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ itis but recovered after hospital treatment .
The virus origin@@ ated in Africa but has been spread north@@ ward by mig@@ rat@@ ory birds and mosqu@@ it@@ oes . There have been several outbreaks in southern and central Europe in recent years . It is found in much of the U.S .
Jonas Sch@@ mid@@ t-@@ Chan@@ as@@ it of Germany 's Bern@@ hard No@@ cht Institute tropical medicine center said that " the un@@ usually warm sum@@ mers of the last two years , triggered by climate change , apparently have contributed to W@@ N@@ V establishing itself north of the Al@@ ps . "

Men undergoing surgery for pro@@ state cancer fare as well without radi@@ o@@ therapy
Men undergoing surgery for pro@@ state cancer fare just as well without radi@@ o@@ therapy , a major study has found .
The findings , from the the largest ever trial exam@@ ining those having surgery for the disease , could spare thousands from gru@@ elling treatment which can have dist@@ ressing si@@ de-@@ effects .
The Royal Mar@@ s@@ den study involved 1,@@ 400 men being treated for pro@@ state cancer .
Half were given immediate radi@@ o@@ therapy , which until now has been standard treatment to prevent the return of disease . The rest were monit@@ ored and only given radi@@ o@@ therapy if there were signs that disease had returned .
Scientists found that five years later , there was almost no difference in disease rec@@ ur@@ rence between the two groups , with those who did not have treatment f@@ aring slightly better .
Pro@@ gression free survival was 85 per cent in the radi@@ o@@ therapy group and 88 per cent in the standard care group .
There was a difference of around 1 per cent between the groups , after data was adjusted to take account of other factors .
The study , funded by Cancer Research UK , found those who had radi@@ o@@ therapy were twice as likely to suffer a worsen@@ ing of ur@@ inary in@@ contin@@ ence , one of the main side effects of pro@@ state cancer treatment .
One year after surgery 5.@@ 3 per cent of patients receiving radi@@ o@@ therapy suffered a deterior@@ ation , compared to 2.@@ 7 per cent who had standard care .
Seth Dun@@ lap Louisiana : WW@@ L Radio host threatening to sue over anti-@@ gay tweet sent the tweet himself , station claims , similar to J@@ us@@ sie Smollett case
A radio host in New Orleans said he received an anti-@@ gay s@@ lu@@ r , sent to him from the radio station 's Twitter account . On Wednesday , WW@@ L host Seth Dun@@ lap , who is openly gay , said he planned to sue the station 's parent company after working for years in a homopho@@ bic and hostile workplace . In a strange turn of events Thursday , the New Orleans Police Department said the homopho@@ bic tweet sent to Dun@@ lap came from none other than Dun@@ lap 's phone .
The tweet in question was sent earlier this month and the day it was sent , Dun@@ lap hosted his show as usual . But the next day , he announced a leave of absence , CBS affili@@ ate WW@@ L-@@ TV reports .
In a statement , Dun@@ lap said 14 people had access WW@@ L 's Twitter account . He claimed he was not one of the people with access to the account .
However , he decided to take a poly@@ graph test to dis@@ pel any speculation that he was the one who sent the tweet to himself , his lawyer Megan Kie@@ fer , said . A lawsuit has not yet been filed on Dun@@ lap 's behalf , but he said in his statement that one would be coming , according to WW@@ L-@@ TV .
WW@@ L Radio , which is a CBS News Radio affili@@ ate but is owned by Enter@@ com , said in a statement it had investigated the tweet and decided to refer the matter to law enforcement officials . " WW@@ L has completed its investigation into the highly offensive , un@@ authorized tweet sent from WW@@ L 's Twitter account on September 10 , which directed a homopho@@ bic s@@ lu@@ r at Seth Dun@@ lap , " said WW@@ L Radio in a statement .
" We determined that the most appropriate next step is to involve law enforcement . At this point , the investigation is in the hands of law enforcement and it is not appropriate for us to comment any further on the substance of our findings , " the statement continue .
The New Orleans Police Department opened their investigation into the tweet and in a police report Thursday revealed a twist in the story : The homopho@@ bic s@@ lu@@ r was allegedly sent from Dun@@ lap 's personal cell@@ phone .
Radio host Seth Dun@@ lap claimed he worked in a homopho@@ bic and hostile workplace for years . After allegedly receiving a tweet with an anti-@@ gay s@@ lu@@ r from the radio station 's Twitter , he threatened to sue .
WW@@ L accused Dun@@ lap of threatening the station for money , NO@@ LA@@ .com reports . WW@@ L alleged the 35@@ -year-old radio host said he would " scor@@ ch the earth " over the tweet and then demanded over $ 1.8 million in compensation . According to a police report obtained by NO@@ LA@@ .com , WW@@ L said Dun@@ lap made this threat when he was facing personal financial issues .
The allegations were made by WW@@ L 's senior vice president Kevin C@@ assi@@ dy and attorneys for the parent company , Enter@@ com . The police department is still working to cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ate the allegations , but have classified the case as possible ex@@ tor@@ tion . In the state of Louisiana , ex@@ tor@@ tion is defined as " the communication of threats to another with the intention ( to ) obtain anything of value . "

Mac Miller death : Third man charged with drug offences
A third man has been arrested and charged with drug offences in connection with the over@@ dose death of rapper Mac Miller .
Steven Walter is suspected of selling counter@@ f@@ eit oxy@@ co@@ done p@@ ills l@@ aced with f@@ ent@@ any@@ l that Miller poss@@ essed before he died of an accident@@ al over@@ dose last year of cocaine , alcohol and the powerful opioid .
Walter is accused of being the source of the p@@ ills that another man , Cameron Pet@@ tit , sold to Miller .
Ryan Re@@ av@@ is , 36 , who was arrested in Lake Hav@@ as@@ u City , Arizona , this week is accused of serving as Walter 's " runner , " who delivered the p@@ ills to Pet@@ tit .
Walter , who is on super@@ vised release over a 2005 drug case , remains in custody .
A Pittsburgh native whose real name was Malcolm James Myers Mc@@ Cor@@ m@@ ick , Miller 's lyrics included fran@@ k discussion of his depression and drug use , earning him fans among some of the biggest names in hi@@ p-@@ hop .
He was also in a two-year relationship with Ari@@ ana Grande that ended earlier in 2018 . After his death she posted an aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ate video of him on her Instagram page and released a song , Thank U Next , that lo@@ v@@ ingly mentioned him .
Miller was one of several musicians whose deaths have been linked in recent years to a national wave of opioid abuse and over@@ doses .
Prince died in 2016 when he took counter@@ f@@ eit p@@ ills l@@ aced with f@@ ent@@ any@@ l that looked like a gener@@ ic version of the pain@@ killer Vic@@ od@@ in .
Matthew Roberts , gu@@ itar@@ ist for the band 3 Do@@ ors Down , also died of an over@@ dose in 2016 , and had f@@ ent@@ any@@ l and hydro@@ co@@ done in his system .
Woman ST@@ R@@ IP@@ S TO NO@@ TH@@ ING in Walmart to prove she didn 't steal
A woman accused of sh@@ op@@ lifting at a Walmart in Mexico City took dra@@ stic measures to prove her inno@@ cence , stri@@ pping stark naked in the middle of the supermarket as a stunned security guard looked on .
In a video of the incident , filmed at the Te@@ pe@@ y@@ ac Walmart branch in Mexico City earlier this week , a security guard can be seen approaching a woman apparently suspected of theft as she ne@@ ared the store 's exit . Her reaction once she was stopped , however , left the watch@@ man spe@@ ech@@ less .
The woman first pe@@ els off her sk@@ irt and begins to proceed toward the exit , but , perhaps uns@@ at@@ is@@ fied her guil@@ t was yet assu@@ aged , soon turned around to remove her shirt as well . Now fully nu@@ de , she stor@@ med off , clothes in hand .
The birth@@ day-@@ suited sh@@ opper 's identity remains unknown , though she appears to have been allowed to leave the premises after the impro@@ mp@@ tu pe@@ ep show .
Simil@@ ar bizarre si@@ ghts are nothing new for Walmart . In July , security cameras caught a Pennsylvania woman relie@@ ving herself into a bin of pot@@ atoes at a Walmart in the town of West Mi@@ ff@@ lin . The woman , who is vis@@ ib@@ ly in@@ tox@@ icated in the footage , was charged with open le@@ w@@ dness , public dr@@ un@@ kenn@@ ess , criminal mis@@ chief and dis@@ or@@ derly conduct for the deed , and became a viral sens@@ ation to boot .
In another case of comp@@ elled supermarket nu@@ d@@ ity this week , a British man , Steve Whiteh@@ ur@@ st , was forced to ex@@ pose himself to security guards after they spotted a mysterious " bul@@ ge " in his pants . He hadn 't stolen anything .
" I can 't help the way I 'm made , " Whiteh@@ ur@@ st told the Sun .
